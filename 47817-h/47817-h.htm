<span class="medium">BESS FLETCHER&#8217;S FIRST WESTERN ACQUAINTANCE</span></h2>


<p>For two days the westbound train had hurried
over the prairies as if it understood the
heart of the girl and strove to gratify her impatience
for a glimpse of the mountains. She sat
at the car window and gazed fascinated at the
scenes which were so new and strange that she
forgot the coach with its tired people&#8212;forgot
even her brother, who sat with his book, bored
and indifferent to the flying panorama.</p>

<p>Her soul left the plush-covered seats and suit-cases
to follow the wild creatures that moved in
the gorges or climbed the wonderful mountain
slopes. She did not hear the repeated &#8220;I&#8217;m going
for a smoke, Bess.&#8221; Her soul was without, her
eyes following a mysterious, half-hidden form.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a deer! Oh, Jim, it&#8217;s a deer!&#8221; she exclaimed
excitedly, turning to her brother for corroboration.
But the flashing brown eyes looked
into the face of a stranger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I beg pardon,&#8221; she breathed, her cheek
flushing. &#8220;My brother sat there only a moment
ago, and I thought I was addressing him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The stranger smiled. &#8220;Then I infer that you
are Miss Fletcher. I just now saw Mr. Fletcher
going into the smoking room. Two years ago I
had the pleasure of making his acquaintance
when he was in the Flathead country.&#8221;</p>

<p>While he was speaking, she noted what a
large man he was, how deliberately he spoke and
in what an unusually musical voice. She saw
the flush of health and strength in his face, contrasting
so greatly to her brother&#8217;s pale, emaciated
countenance. She wondered what color his
eyes were, but as he looked at her with fleeting
glances she could not tell. The thought flashed
through her mind that he would be very handsome
if only he would open his eyes frankly. In
fact, so preoccupied was she reading the young
man that she was scarcely aware of what he was
saying to her. Just then she saw James coming.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, Mr. Davis! I&#8217;m glad to meet you
once more.&#8221; Fletcher reached forth his hand in
friendly recognition.</p>

<p>&#8220;Permit me to introduce my sister, whom I
am taking to the Flathead with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a nod the stranger explained how he
had already had the pleasure of speaking with
Miss Fletcher.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not looking like the hale and hearty
cowboy whom I saw two years ago riding over
the range on the reservation,&#8221; he continued.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> &#8220;It
must be the return to civilization did not agree
with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was very well until a few months ago,&#8221;
said Fletcher, &#8220;but the worry and strain of settling
my father&#8217;s affairs used me up generally,
and I am now going West to recuperate. I love
the Western life, with its sunshine, its out-of-doors,
its fresh air and vast breathing space. I
wouldn&#8217;t exchange the three summers on the
range for all my life in the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know, Mr. Davis, I have become so
fascinated with tales of the cattle country that
I feel almost as enthusiastic as my brother,&#8221; said
Bess, brushing the stray lock of fluffy brown hair
out of her eye. &#8220;Do you think,&#8221; she continued,
&#8220;that I shall love the West as he does?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; said Davis, with a swift glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I already know what a cayuse is, and also
a lariat, though I am not so sure as regards a
teepee; still, if I remember correctly, it is something
good to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Simultaneously both gentlemen burst forth
in hearty laughter, and when Davis could speak
he said: &#8220;I am afraid, Miss Fletcher, your appetite
will be gone when you see or even smell
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bess wrinkled her brow in perplexity. &#8220;Oh,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;James has told me so many tales of
the Indians and cowboys and all, that I scarcely
know what to believe. Nevertheless, it won&#8217;t be
long now before I shall have solved a few of the
mysteries at least.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Davis began carefully to roll a cigarette,
shaping it daintily with his thumb and index
fingers; then poising it carefully between his lips,
he sought a match in his vest pocket and excused
himself, hoping to meet them both very often
during the summer. Bess watched him as he
slowly sauntered toward the end of the car with
a look of inquiry.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I would like him better if he would
look directly at one. Who is he, James? A
cattleman or cowboy, or what is it you called
them&#8212;oh, yes, squaw man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to guess again, Bess. He is
Dave Davis, the Indian agent of the Flathead
Reservation. He is probably on his way to the
sub-agency at Ronan.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave a little sigh in answer, and asked
how long it would be before the train reached
Selish.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear you are nearly worn out, James. You
had better lie down and rest. It is now four
o&#8217;clock, and at five you say we will reach the
end of our train journey. It&#8217;s been rather long
and tedious. How far away New York begins to
feel, doesn&#8217;t it? Oh, I wonder if I shall really
like it away out here in the West?&#8221;</p>

<p>James quietly settled down for a nap, and
Bess went on with her mental soliloquy. The
West! What had she not dreamed of the West!
Its wonderful mountains, so great and bold, rock-ribbed
and ancient as the sun, verdant with the
towering pines, and again, white and softened by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the crown of winter. In fancy she had seen their
rugged sides caressed by crystal streams, and had
stooped to drink where deer had splashed. Then
forth stretched the plain, far into the blue horizon.
On she dreamed, till the porter warned her
it was nearly time for them to leave the train.
Hurriedly awakening her brother, he hastily
gathered together their numerous grips and
boxes. So busily engaged were her hands that
she had to blow the persistent wisp of hair out
of her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;For pity&#8217;s sake, Bess, can&#8217;t you pin that
bunch of hair up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t stay up, James. I get so annoyed
at the old forelock that sometimes I feel like
pulling it out,&#8221; and all unconsciously she repeated
the motion, at which they both laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here we are, dearie, at last. I wonder if
anyone will meet us. Come, let the porter help
you off with a few of those bird cages.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they stepped from the train she felt to
everything which came within her range of observation
like a huge interrogation point. She
glanced hurriedly about, hoping to see Henry
West, and wondering if she would know him.
Just then she saw Mr. Davis lifting his hat to
her, both in recognition and farewell, as he
walked to a man holding a beautiful saddle horse.
The Indian agent glanced back at the tall, graceful
girl, with her pretty traveling dress and hat
of brown. She could not know that he noted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
what an air she walked, head and shoulders erect,
chin up aggressively, nor that he thought:</p>

<p>&#8220;Gad! but she is great! And what a treat
after three years of Indians. I shall certainly see
you often, Miss Fletcher.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see him anywhere, James?&#8221; Bess
was all animation.</p>

<p>&#8220;West? No, sister. We better hurry over
here where there is the best little hotel you ever
saw or heard tell of; so immaculately clean, and
excellent food&#8212;plain, but cooked to the queen&#8217;s
taste. That is, if it&#8217;s run by the same party who
used to be here. My mouth still waters in recollection
of some of the good trout and muffins
which I have had at Mrs. Strong&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nestled closely to the hillside was the hotel,
and as Bess was greeted by a sweet-faced girl and
her mother she wondered if all Western hospitality
were as cordial.</p>

<p>James had ordered their trunks brought over,
and soon Bess came from her room fresh and
clean and rested, dressed in a becoming tan-colored
riding suit of corduroy.</p>

<p>It was early May. In the mountains the evenings
were still cold, and a blazing fire crackled as
they sat down to dinner. It seemed to Bess that
she never was so hungry in all her life. Biscuits
never tasted so good before. She saw, with
gratification, that James ate as he had not in
weeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever feel, James, that you could eat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
everything in sight? That&#8217;s just the way I feel
now, but I&#8217;ll try to leave enough for you, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>This brother and sister were all the world to
each other. The mother died while Bess was still
young, and most of her life had been spent in the
convent school. During her summer vacation
she was often with her father and brother in New
York. The past year and a half, since the death
of their father, Bess and James had been together
constantly. He had hoped to carry on his
father&#8217;s law business, but a severe illness necessitated
his leaving the city, and so he gladly accepted
the offer of Henry West to come to his
ranch and assume the foremanship.</p>

<p>James and Henry West had been in school at
Harvard together, and later both began the study
of law. The close association of years caused the
insoluble bond of friendship between them.</p>

<p>Colin West, the father of Henry, was a
Scotchman, of education, tact and good judgment;
a man respected by everyone with whom he
came in contact. Fate or fortune had placed him
in the West while still a young man. His wife
was half Indian blood, and yet one of the most
refined and intellectual of women. Her son was
proving himself an able manager of the vast
herds of cattle and buffalo which Colin West had
accumulated, and since his death four years ago
Henry had had the entire management of the
ranch.</p>

<p>Here James spent three long, delightful summers.
Here he learned to ride and &#8220;rope&#8221; like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
any of the cowboys on the range. It was always
with reluctance that he left, after the fall round-up,
to take up his studies again. How glad he
was to return now, in hopes of soon regaining
his health and strength. He had hesitated in
bringing his sister into this new life, and yet he
could not leave her alone in New York.</p>

<p>She was wild with delight when he asked her
to come, for ever since she had listened to his
never-ending, interesting tales of the West had
she hoped that she, too, might come to know its
lure. She loved out-of-door life, and the few
months of her vacation in the city were usually
spent riding, so that she had become a very good
horsewoman, and, best of all, had grown to
strong and perfect womanhood. She was girlish,
and her twenty years rested lightly on her shoulders.
Her optimistic and sunshiny disposition
won for her the love and admiration of all her
friends, and even strangers smiled at her happy
face. As most of her life had been spent at school
among sweet-faced nuns, she had grown up uncontaminated
by the world, pure-minded and
whole-souled. Her faith was implicit, and never
yet had she had a rude awakening to the fact
that all were not true nor good, nor even sincere.</p>

<p>Several times she had considered seriously becoming
a nun herself, but her love of nature, of
out-of-doors, of friends, of her father and brother,
of the world generally, made her pause. Then,
too, she knew her bright and merry nature could
never endure the strict confines of the cloister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and the shadow of the somber black robes. &#8220;No,
I cannot, for I am not good enough,&#8221; was always
her mental decision. And now that her father
was dead and she and James were alone, she had
put the thought from her mind entirely.</p>

<p>The nuns realized what her work would be,
for her talents in music and painting were extraordinary;
and she also had that gift, which few
possess, of making a success of anything she
undertook. Failure was not in her vocabulary,
and she never used the word, either mentally or
audibly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why in the world, Bess, have you put on
your riding togs?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bess looked up with surprise and replied:
&#8220;Why, James, are we not going horseback to the
<em>HW</em> Ranch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t start for the ranch tonight. It is
at least thirty-five miles, and besides you can
never ride so far, even though Henry West should
bring saddle horses. The stage leaves here for
Polson early in the morning, and we will, in all
probability, meet him there. Still, he wired he
would meet us here at Selish. It is early yet, and
he may come soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a little impatient gesture of putting
back the hair from her forehead, and with her
eyes sparkling, half defiantly and half in fun,
Bess said: &#8220;My dear, solicitous brother, let me
tell you a few things right now. I am here in
the great West where you have told me there is
perfect and untrammeled freedom. Don&#8217;t begin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
using a lot of don&#8217;ts and can&#8217;ts, for I am going to
ride&#8212;&#8216;and ever to ride&#8217;, when and where and
with whom my fancy dictates; I am going to talk
with anyone who interests me, be he white or
full-blood Indian. I am going to&#8212;Oh, what am
I not going to do!&#8212;even shock my dear, old
brother, half to death, every day&#8212;you dear&#8221;&#8212;She
jumped from her seat at the table and after
flinging her arms around his neck, she was out
of the room, her merry laugh ringing in his ears,
before he had time to remonstrate.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear little sister,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;I pray
there may no harm come to you, and that your
frankness may not be misconstrued by those <em>who
are ever ready to criticise</em>.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<span class="medium">THE GOLDEN GLIMPSE</span></h2>


<p>Bess had donned her fluffy brown tam-o-shanter
and stood on the veranda. Shadows of
evening were silently gathering in the valley, and
yet she could see that beyond the hill the sun
still shone. &#8220;That hill looks rather high,&#8221; she
said briskly, &#8220;but I do so long to see what lies
beyond it. I think I&#8217;ll go up the road and take
a glimpse before the sun sets. Brother won&#8217;t
miss me and I&#8217;ll only be gone a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she walked she stooped to pick some shining
butter-cups, and to thrust in her hair waxen
leaves of the Oregon grape, with its bright yellow
clusters of blossoms. So interested was she
in each new leaf and stone that the crest of the
long, winding road had been reached before she
was aware. Lifting her eyes she caught her
breath, and unconsciously lifted her hands in
silent adoration of the glorious panorama spread
out before her, her first real look at the &#8220;golden
West.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was golden indeed, for the sun had just
dipped beyond the purple mountains and the
scene was flooded with golden light. Away,
away to the North and East and West stretched
the vast rolling valley of the Indian Reservation,
the Little Bitter Root mountains guarding it on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the left and the Mission Range rising modestly
on the East. She could see but the faint purple
outline of the low hills to the northward. Dotted
here and there were soft greens, of irrigated
reaches, and trees, showing where the waters
flowed and at which the grazing herds quenched
their thirst. Bess was filled with awe at the
magnificent scene, and reverently clasped her
hands and lifted her eyes as she realized the immensity
of it. When the Lord of Hosts should
upon the last day assemble all the people of the
earth together in judgment, what more fitting
place could he choose! There he might sit on
the crest of yonder mountain, with his host of
angels about him, and below in the expanse of
sweeping prairie, unmarred by the hand of man,
adorned only by the divine touch of bountiful
Providence, might convene all,&#8212;the good might
here find a foretaste of heaven, and the less fortunate
could hope for mercy of which they had
not dreamed nor even dared to hope. Surely the
Creator of all this beauty would condone the
faults of poor, frail humanity who had fallen
from grace in the hard and bitter struggle of
life.</p>

<p>So she stood, entranced, in the fading light of
day, unheeding the last thrilling notes of meadow
lark, or the balsam-laden air wafted to her from
the evergreen slopes of the mountains. Closing
her eyes in a softly murmured prayer, she stood
silent and motionless, and when she again looked
upon the scene the grayness of early night had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
settled over all, softening every outline with
indistinctness.</p>

<p>Abruptly she turned to hurry back to the
hotel, when, in the distance, she heard the clatter
of approaching hoofs. A little alarm of fear and
loneliness stirred in her breast and she hurried
down the road. All the bravado with which she
had left her brother had suddenly deserted her,
and she could feel the heart-throbs in her throat
nearly choking her. She did not even glance up
the road, although she heard the hoof-beats ever
coming nearer. &#8220;What if it should be Indians!&#8221;
The thought filled her with ever-increasing alarm.
On she sped, as rapidly as the gradual descent
permitted, then she struck a rock, and ere she
could regain her footing she fell on her knees.
Scarcely had the damp earth left an imprint on
her skirt when she regained her feet, and now
glanced behind her.</p>

<p>Silhouetted against the evening sky, on the
very crest of the hill, she saw, in her momentary
glance, a lone horseman leading a second horse.
The next instant they had begun slowly to descend
the hill.</p>

<p>Bess, seeing a huge, flat boulder to the right
of the road, stepped out upon it so that she
could be distinctly seen, even tho it was now
rapidly growing dark. She looked up the road
at the approaching trio, her face raised fearlessly
and confidently, although her knees were still
trembling.</p>

<p>As the man passed he courteously lifted his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
broad sombrero, speaking at the same time in a
low, commanding voice to the horse he was leading.
&#8220;Mauchacho, I am ashamed of you! Did
you never see a lady before? You certainly&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>But his voice grew indistinct in the distance
and Bess did not hear the end of the chiding the
dainty animal had received for pricking up his
ears and pulling back on the hackamore.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank goodness, it was not an Indian after
all,&#8221; she said aloud, as she hurried down to the
hotel.</p>

<p>The lone rider had already reached the steps,
and she saw James heartily shaking both his
hands. She stopped a moment watching the
pair standing in the flood of light which poured
out of the open doorway. The stranger was tall
and straight as an arrow, even though his shoulders
had a tired droop. Heavily fringed leather
&#8220;chapps&#8221; covered his trousers, a mackinaw coat,
carelessly fastened and a white silk handkerchief
knotted loosely about his throat completed his
unpretentious costume. She could see that his
face looked dark and swarthy, but it was lighted
by a smile of greeting, displaying a row of firm,
even teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, old boy, it seems mighty good to see
you once more, and to breathe this air again. I
had just started to find my sister, who has
strayed off somewhere, when I heard you coming,&#8221;
Bess heard her brother saying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span> &#8220;and I hope
I may find her before someone lariats her for a
maverick and sticks his brand on her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The stranger laughed. &#8220;You have not forgotten
all your Western jingle, even though you
have been gone a year and a half. I saw a young
woman up the road a way. Perhaps she is the
sister you are searching.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then James caught sight of the girl, and
hastily summoning her to come forward, introduced
her to his old friend and comrade, after
scolding her, half seriously, for staying away so
long without telling him where she was going.</p>

<p>Smiling at her brother, Bess Fletcher turned
to look into one of the strongest faces and the
most unfathomable eyes she had ever seen. The
features were unmistakably Indian, and it was
hard to believe that the man was only a quarter-blood,
as she knew. The square chin and wide,
sensitive mouth, the dilated nostrils and prominent
cheek bones stamped the face with character,
strength and determination. One could
see in the gloomy depths of the eyes a strange intermingling
of sympathy, with the truculent
gleam which had shone for centuries in the eyes
of his ancestors. They impressed one, that he
would either be wholly white, or entirely Indian,
according to circumstances or environment.</p>

<p>As Bess turned to acknowledge the introduction,
her hand, half raised, paused as she measured
this man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. West. But&#8212;but,&#8221; she added hesitatingly,
&#8220;you do not look one bit as I&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>West&#8217;s lips parted in a smile as he replied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
&#8220;Had you expected to see me with a blanket on
and a feather in my hair? I hope you are not
greatly disappointed.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment she was nonplussed. &#8220;Oh, no!
But you are different somehow, and if there is
any disappointment it is a happy one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Miss Fletcher,&#8221; came in a low
and almost inaudible voice.</p>

<p>James had been listening with interest. &#8220;I
guess I had impressed her that you looked more
like&#8212;&#8221; he floundered and ended tactlessly, &#8220;well,
like me, than an Indian, Henry.&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;breed&#8217;s&#8221; eyes closed spasmodically and
his teeth shut hard before he replied. &#8220;Jim,
sometimes I feel that I could willingly be skinned
alive, if it would make me&#8212;like you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Never before in all their relationship had this
outburst of confidence escaped him; yet here in
the presence of this beautiful, fair woman, his
usual reticence and reserve for the moment left
him, and the secret desire of his heart and soul
escaped his lips. Angry at his loss of control, he
turned and said, &#8220;I had entirely forgotten the
horses. We came at a pretty swift pace from
Polson. I would have reached here before train-time,
but Eagle got a stone in his shoe, and I
had the devil&#8217;s own time getting it out. I must
go and attend to their beds and supper.&#8221; With
this he stepped out into the gloom.</p>

<p>Bess had gone into the house and was standing
warming herself near the stove before her
brother also entered and with a shiver hastened
to the fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Jim, isn&#8217;t he just splendid!&#8221; cried the
girl. &#8220;I had no idea there were such men as he
away out here in the West! No wonder you
rave over him and always sing his praises.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know, Bess, if he were my own
brother I could not honor and love him more.
At college he was so superior in mind, ability,
and morals to the majority of his colleagues, that
everyone looked up to him. He was one of them
and no gathering was quite complete without
Henry West. I never thought of him as an
Indian, and anyway&#8212;that is his greatest charm.
Whatever else he may be, he certainly is a gentleman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bess threw her arms impulsively about his
neck. Then, &#8220;Good night, dearie, I am half
jealous of him already. Tell him good-night for
me. I want to retire so as to be up for our early
start in the morning. I am tired, more tired than
I knew. Don&#8217;t stay up late. You must be worn
out. Brother, I believe I love this new, strange
land!&#8221; With a kiss she left him and went to her
room.</p>

<p>Hastily undressing, she was soon ready for
bed. Going to the window she put up the shade,
and placing her hands between her brow and the
window she peered into the night. Her bosom
stirred with a tremor of excitement as she whispered,
&#8220;The West! The mysterious West! And
he&#8212;Henry West.&#8221; She flung the window wide
open, and hastily getting into bed was soon
asleep.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<span class="medium">HENRY WEST&#8217;S IDEAL</span></h2>


<p>The aromatic smell of coffee and bacon filled
Bess&#8217; nostrils as she awoke to a glorious morning.
At first she looked about in wonderment, trying
to think where she was. With the sudden realization
she sprang out of the snug bed, and going to
the open window, filled her lungs with deep
draughts of pure, mountain air. It did not take
her many minutes to dress and place her belongings
in the trunk, which she fastened so it
would be all ready and cause no delay. One of
her habits was punctuality, and she never felt
that she had a right to infringe upon the time of
others by keeping them waiting. She came downstairs,
and going into the sitting-room to see if
her brother was there, was greeted by a cheery
&#8220;good-morning&#8221; from Mrs. Strong.</p>

<p>&#8220;Breakfast is nearly ready, Miss Fletcher.
The boys are out getting the horses ready and
putting the trunks on the stage.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then they came upon the porch, and Bess
hastened forward with pleasant greetings.
&#8220;James, your cheeks are getting tanned already.&#8221;
Turning to Henry West, she continued, &#8220;You
are certainly good medicine to have such a
marked effect upon my brother so soon.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;I have never aspired to the dignity of the
Medicine-man, Miss Fletcher, but with your permission
I shall certainly consider the matter,&#8221;
he replied facetiously.</p>

<p>The flush of shyness mounted to her cheeks.
&#8220;Really, Mr. West, you&#8212;I&#8212;I did not mean it in
that way,&#8221; she said, trying to cover her confusion.</p>

<p>He felt sorry for her and assured her that she
might say anything she wished concerning the
Indians, as neither his mother nor himself were
at all sensitive on the subject.</p>

<p>However, Bess was greatly relieved when just
then Mabel Strong came to announce breakfast.
Again their appetites seemed abnormal, and the
rainbow trout, caught not an hour before in the
stream which skirted the mountains, together
with the delicious muffins, bacon and eggs,
golden-browned potatoes and coffee, disappeared
as if by magic.</p>

<p>Henry West ate sparingly, and watched
James with gratification as he enjoyed his meal.
&#8220;Jim, old boy,&#8221; he said, in his low, softly modulated
voice, &#8220;you&#8217;ll be ready for the June round-up
if you keep up that clip at grub.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about me, Mr. West?&#8221; asked Bess, as
she helped herself to the third muffin and the
second egg.</p>

<p>James threw up his head with a hearty laugh.
&#8220;If you keep up your &#8216;clip&#8217; there won&#8217;t be a cayuse
on <em>HW</em> ranch that could carry you a mile.&#8221;</p>

<p>They all joined in the laugh, and then Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
West asked if he might be excused and go fetch
the horses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. West, why did you bring two horses?&#8221;
asked Bess, later, as she watched the animals
brought up to the porch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I thought perhaps that James would
like to ride, but I am afraid he better not attempt
it just yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, let me! Now James,&#8221; as he raised his
hand in remonstrance, &#8220;you know it doesn&#8217;t tire
me in the least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dearie, but riding a few hours on the
smooth pavements of New York is entirely different
from a thirty-five mile trip across an
Indian reservation.&#8221;</p>

<p>A look of disappointment clouded her face,
and Henry West hastened to speak: &#8220;Mauchacho
is perfectly safe, and when she gets tired we can
stop and wait for the stage.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bess looked at him with grateful eyes and
cried impulsively: &#8220;You de&#8212; oh, thank you,
Mr. West,&#8221; correcting herself hastily.</p>

<p>Henry West looked at her with a sympathetic
glance, and had she looked she might have
read with what eloquence his eyes asked her
to speak that word&#8212;dear.</p>

<p>James saw that any further expostulation
would be useless, so he helped West adjust the
stirrups.</p>

<p>Suddenly the &#8217;breed looked at Bess. &#8220;But
perhaps you use a side-saddle, Miss Fletcher? In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
that case I fear you&#8217;ll have to be disappointed,
and go in the stage after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my, no!&#8221; she cried before the words
were out of his mouth. &#8220;James taught me to ride
like a boy, and besides I know how a horse
should be guided across the neck.&#8221; Her chin
went up with a saucy tilt at her superior knowledge
as she went around in front of the horse
to &#8220;get acquainted,&#8221; as she called it. West
watched her as she rubbed her nose against the
dainty animal&#8217;s, unconscious of his interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;So your name is Mauchacho? I wonder
what that means? And you have a forelock
which bothers your eyes, the same as mine does.
I wonder if you are used to skirts?&#8221;</p>

<p>West came around where she was standing,
and as if in reply to the questions which she had
been asking the horse, he said, &#8220;Mauchacho was
my sister&#8217;s horse. He has never been used at
any of the round-ups. No one has been on his
back, excepting myself, since&#8212;since Helen&#8212;&#8221;
After a moment he went on: &#8220;I named him
Mauchacho because it is the Indian word for
bird. He is very swift, and in a race always
takes the lead.&#8221; He snapped his fingers, and the
horse lifted up his front foot and daintily placed
it in his master&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shake hands with your new mistress now.&#8221;
Then he added: &#8220;Take him. He is yours to
keep, Miss Fletcher.&#8221; Before Bess could recover
from her astonishment and embarrassment he
added:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span> &#8220;I notice that you have the same idiosyncrasy
that Mauchacho has.&#8221; Bess tried to
think if his remark was a reflection on her unruly
foretop, and was about to ask him, when
he left her and walked to James, already seated
in the stage.</p>

<p>Presently, when he turned, he saw Bess already
in the saddle and adjusting her skirts.
With a smile at her independence, he swung into
his own saddle and started up the road, saying:
&#8220;We&#8217;ll lead, as the stage may be a little slow and
the dust is annoying.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bess turned to wave her hand and throw a
kiss in farewell to Mrs. Strong and Mabel, who
had come out on the porch to witness the departure.
With a parting &#8220;Don&#8217;t get lonely nor
tired, brother,&#8221; and a wave of her handkerchief
toward the stage, she urged Mauchacho forward
to join Eagle and his rider.</p>

<p>The horses started steadily up the road which
wound around the hillside. West had not spoken
since she joined him, but silently made notes
of her graceful seat in the saddle; how she held
the reins firmly, yet lightly, in her left hand;
how her shoulders were flung back; how her nostrils
were dilating and her chest was moving in
rhythmic, full breathing. Once, as she breathed
long and deep, she cried out, &#8220;Oh, it seems as if
I never shall get all this delicious air I want!
What a glorious morning! See, the sun is only
just peeping over the hills! Oh, the lazy old fellow!
What time is it, I wonder?&#8221;</p>

<p>Henry West replied without first glancing at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
his watch, &#8220;It is about half after seven,&#8221; but to
assure her he opened his watch and simply added,
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You stood there last evening,&#8221; he said, pointing
to the flat boulder upon which Bess had stood
so tremblingly in the twilight. &#8220;I felt that it
was you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The horses were breathing hard when they
reached the summit, and West drew rein that
they might recover from the exertion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you wear spurs?&#8221; inquired Bess.
&#8220;I supposed no cowboy&#8217;s costume was ever complete
without them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do wear them when I am riding a cayuse
and after cattle or on the round-up,&#8221; he explained,
&#8220;but Eagle nor Mauchacho nor my other
thoroughbred doesn&#8217;t need them. Do you, old
boy?&#8221; he interrogated, bending over and giving
the beautiful horse a sound &#8220;love-pat&#8221; on the
neck.</p>

<p>Again Bess had become entranced at the wondrous
scene which lay before her, even more
glorious than the one of the night before. A song
arose to her lips. As the first few notes unconsciously
escaped her, and the rich, full melody
floated out upon the morning air, she suddenly
collected herself. &#8220;Oh, I could not help it,&#8221; she
apologized.</p>

<p>Henry West looked at her with pleading eyes
as he begged her to go on. &#8220;Please don&#8217;t mind
me. Sing out the joy in your heart,&#8221; he said,
gently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>As side by side the horses began the stony
ascent of the opposite side of the hill, she sang,
at first softly, then forgetting all else in the
world except that she was young and happy and
glad to be alive, the music became full, sweet and
strong, and in her rich, sympathetic voice she
poured forth her heart.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;The sun is rising o&#8217;er the ocean,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The smiling waters greet the day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The joyous winds to dancing motion<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wake the billows and the spray.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See where the clouds roll up the mountains!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Night has her misty banner furled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And springing from a thousand fountains<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Light and joy o&#8217;erflow the world!&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here she paused, her heart too full to go on.
Neither spoke, and when they had reached the
foot of the hill and the long, level stretch of road
lay before them, the horses started into a swift
pace across the plain. On, on they went, gradually
slowing into a steady, swinging gait. Both
horses were single-footers, and they moved along
without any apparent effort. How delightful it
was! How Bess enjoyed every moment! The
brisk morning air painted her cheeks rosily and
filled her large, brown eyes with sparkling excitement.
Occasionally a little cry of keenest
pleasure escaped Bess&#8217; lips.</p>

<p>Henry West was apparently oblivious to all
about him; his eyes were looking straight ahead
and his lips were closed firmly, as if with an effort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
to restrain his thoughts. All his life he had
thought of the day and dreamed of the time
when his ideal might be by his side. On his lonely
rides across the plains or hills in quest of cattle
or looking after his horses, his heart and
soul had been filled with thoughts of Her. Never
had he found her among the girls of his own people.
Never had he seen her in all his years at
school and college, although many who were fair
and sweet would gladly have accepted his attentions.
Always a welcome guest at the homes of
his acquaintances, entertained and feted until he
had become surfeited with it all, his heart was
still an empty void, and his soul still longed for
her of whom he dreamed.</p>

<p>Last night she came! The moment he heard
her voice he knew it! The instant he saw her
eyes, her face, her hair, her form, he felt like
crying out in his exquisite pain of unbearable
joy, &#8220;At last you have come; you for whom I
have hoped, longed, sought, waited through all
the ages of time! Oh, my love, my life! And
yet I can not, dare not even presume to touch
your hand! Oh, the irony of fate! You are so
fair, so white&#8212;I, O God! I am but an Indian!
They say we know how to hate! We know, too,
how to love; but how much, how hopelessly, I
never knew till now! And yet&#8221;&#8212;a swift thought
came&#8212;&#8220;and yet&#8212;my mother! How I love her!
What an honor to be my mother&#8217;s son!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bess stole a shy glance at the set face of her
companion and wondered what he could be pondering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
so deeply. He had not spoken for a long
time, and she half feared to break the silence.
Miles passed under the horses&#8217; hoofs, and yet he
was silent.</p>

<p>Suddenly he looked at her with self-reproach.
&#8220;Pardon me, Miss Fletcher, but you certainly
must be getting tired.&#8221; He hastily leaped from
his horse, throwing the reins over the beautiful
creature&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>Eagle shook himself as if glad to be relieved
of his burden. West came to Bess&#8217; side and assisted
her to dismount. He had anticipated that
her knees would not sustain her weight, and
clasped her in his arms to keep her from falling.
Immediately the horses, with reins trailing on
the ground, began munching the soft green grass,
slowly picking here and there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ouch!&#8221; said Bess, as her feet touched the
earth. &#8220;How funny one&#8217;s knees feel after riding
so far,&#8221; and she awkwardly began to move forward.</p>

<p>As her soft hair brushed his face when she
dismounted West could scarcely refrain from
placing his hand upon the fluffy and wind-tossed
tresses. Taking off his mackinaw, he spread it
on the ground, telling her to be seated for a
moment, and strode to the feeding horses. Presently
he returned, and Bess, having risen, looked
up at him with a bright smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. West, why do the horses walk like crawfish?&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled at her comparison, and told her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
to avoid stepping on the reins and the attendant
jerk to their mouths.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think I will soon be toughened like
you?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; West replied. &#8220;You soon will be
able to ride half a day, or even more, without
becoming much fatigued. At first you must go
easy and not ride too long at a stretch.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stood gazing about her at the vast herds
of cattle and horses grazing all about the valley
and the gentle slopes. In front she could see
the heavily willowed banks of a stream, and secretly
rejoiced, for she was longing for a drink.</p>

<p>West was looking behind him over the road
they had just come. &#8220;Well, the stage is not
so slow today. Old Charley must be pounding
them on the back.&#8221;</p>

<span class="medium">THE HESITATING LARIAT</span></h2>


<p>Bess could discern in the distance the stage
with its little, trailing cloud of dust. &#8220;Please
let us mount again. I&#8217;m quite rested, and want
to reach the stream before the stage arrives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are thirsty, Miss Fletcher?&#8221; he asked,
solicitously, hastening to assist her to remount.</p>

<p>The horses started eagerly forward, the scent
of fresh water in their nostrils.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are nearly half-way home. The bridge
yonder is about half the distance,&#8221; said West.</p>

<p>Suddenly he was so alarmed by a shrill cry
from the girl that he brought the surprised Eagle
almost to his haunches with a sudden stop.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; she cried, pointing to the right of
her. Instantly West turned his horse. &#8220;My
God!&#8221; he cried, starting Eagle across the rolling
land. She saw a horse throw his rider, and in a
moment more drag him by the foot, which in
some way had become fastened in the stirrup.</p>

<p>Bess tried in vain to restrain Mauchacho,
who insisted upon following his companion.
Scarcely a half mile intervened, and Bess could
see Eagle speeding like a veritable bird. She
saw West swinging his lariat about his head with
measured movements. Suddenly he hesitated,
holding his hand for the instant still&#8212;then with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
one more vigorous swing the rope shot out, hissing
and uncoiling like a huge snake, and in the
instant it caught the fleeing horse firmly by both
front feet and threw him with a crash to the
ground. At the same moment Eagle braced
himself like a rock, and West secured the lariat
about the pommel of the saddle. So swiftly had
it all happened that Bess cried out in amazement
and wonder.</p>

<p>West reached the frightened horse, now
struggling wildly, in time to save the man from
being kicked to death. The foot had been
wrenched from the stirrup, and the man lay
silent and motionless upon the ground.</p>

<p>When Bess reached the spot she sprang from
her horse and hastened forward to be of assistance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot see how anyone who knows a horse
could possibly have such an accident,&#8221; West was
saying, as if to himself. &#8220;The horse surely could
not have seen a &#8216;rattler,&#8217; as it is too early for
them; and, besides, I have never seen one down
on this flat. Looks to me like confounded carelessness!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, is he hurt?&#8221; she inquired, but West had
mounted Mauchacho and was speeding to the
stream. Bess lifted the bruised and bleeding
head into her lap. As she carefully wiped the
dirt from the eyes and face she discovered to her
surprise that it was the same Mr. Davis whom
she had only met the evening before on the train
at Selish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;See&#8212;look!&#8221; she exclaimed excitedly, as
West returned, his hat dripping with the water
it contained. &#8220;It is Mr. Davis!&#8221;</p>

<p>Henry West nearly spilled the precious
liquid. His eyes flashed with hatred, and his
teeth clenched so hard that she could scarcely
hear his words. &#8220;You&#8212;know&#8212;that&#8212;that&#8212;devil!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bess was so confounded at the look of enmity
and hate that she turned pale with fear.</p>

<p>The next moment, with trembling hands, she
was helping Henry West to resuscitate the unconscious
man. Cool, dripping handkerchiefs
bathed his brow and temples. Upon examining
the foot which had caused so much mischief,
West saw that it was swelling rapidly, and soon
dexterous fingers had unfastened the laces and
were tenderly removing the shoe. All the passion
was gone from his face, leaving it pale and
anxious. Again he hastened to the stream,
quickly returning with the hat filled with water.
How they worked, these two! Perspiration
streamed from their faces as they chafed his
arms and hands and bathed the bruised and swollen
ankle. Once they caught a fleeting twitch
of the eyelids, and, encouraged by the knowledge
that there was still life, they renewed all their
efforts.</p>

<p>Suddenly West put his hand upon the man&#8217;s
breast, Bess thought to feel his heart beats, but
instantly she understood as he drew a flask from
the inside of the coat. West forced the lips apart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and succeeded in pouring some of the brandy
into Davis&#8217; mouth. The effect was almost instantaneous.
The eyelids fluttered and a groan
of torture escaped the lips. Again he relapsed
into unconsciousness, but for only a few minutes,
for soon he opened his eyes and looked into the
girl&#8217;s face. Then a spasm of pain contracted his
face frightfully, and even West turned aside that
he might not see. They gave him more of the
brandy, which seemed to strengthen the man,
and also made the suffering, for the moment at
least, less acute. Not a word had they spoken
since that first moment.</p>

<p>West now watched for the stage, standing
near Mauchacho, first releasing the horse which
he had thrown. With trailing reins the animal
now stood quietly beside Eagle, who seemed to
be looking at him with &#8220;horse&#8221; contempt.</p>

<p>Just then the stage came in sight from behind
a rise, and West swung upon Mauchacho,
hastening to hail it. Soon Bess could see the
men hurrying to where she sat with her again
unconscious burden. With a strong blanket for
a stretcher, four of them carefully placed the
wounded man upon it, and bore him to the stage.
James brought Eagle and Davis&#8217; horse, while
Bess walked behind, leading Mauchacho. Carefully
they placed Davis in the stage. James insisted
that his sister continue her journey in the
vehicle while he rode with West. They stopped
at the bridge to water the horses, and then proceeded
slowly on their way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>Bess was doing everything in her power to
alleviate the pain of the man, whose head now
rested against her shoulder. She did not move,
and scarcely dared to breathe, lest she should
disturb him. She could feel the damp, cold
drops of perspiration standing out like beads on
the white forehead and the bruised cheek. So
great was her sympathy that she, too, seemed to
be in the torture of pain. The other occupants
of the stage watched her with interest and appreciation.</p>

<p>West rode near to tell her that James and he
would hasten on and have a more comfortable
conveyance at Polson by which to bring Mr. Davis
to the <em>HW</em> Ranch.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<span class="medium">THE MOTLEY SPECTATORS AT POLSON</span></h2>


<p>It was nearly one o&#8217;clock when the stage
reached Polson, at the foot of the Lake. As it
drove up in front of the hotel Bess saw that
James and Henry West had already arrived. A
curious and anxious crowd were gathered in the
road and on the porch, each one striving to get a
look at the Indian Agent, of whose accident they
had already heard. It was a motley crowd; here
and there were blanketed Indians with their
squaws and papooses and numerous mangy
curs; in groups were standing the lighter colored
half-breeds, some in white men&#8217;s clothing, others
with blankets carelessly folded about them. Some
were fastidious in their beaded leggings and
wide-brimmed hats, their gay-colored &#8217;kerchiefs
and shirts, while others were scarcely able to
hide their copper-colored bodies with their
scanty possessions, so unfortunate had they been
in their last gambling game. Several white men
and women could also be seen intermingling
with the Indians or standing aloof beside the
buildings. They were evidently passengers en
route across the reservation, or waiting to go up
the Flathead Lake and river to Kalispell.</p>

<p>The <em>Klondyke</em> had been steamed up and ready
to leave for more than an hour. The passengers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
hurried to get aboard, the whistle blew and the
boat started slowly to steam out into the Lake.</p>

<p>The while, Henry West, assisted by a number
of the spectators, was making Mr. Davis as comfortable
as he could with numerous blankets on
a buckboard. The men watched him with incredulity,
for they all knew the animosity which
existed between these two men. How any man
could show such consideration and feeling for
another who was his mortal enemy they could
not understand! Neither did they know the
cause of the hatred. Some said that Henry West
knew of some &#8216;crooked work&#8217; Davis had been carrying
on, yet he could not say a word while he
lived on the reserve and was under the authority
of the Indian Agent. But this was conjecture.
No one but Henry West and his God knew the
circumstances which made him hate the man
with all the powers of his soul.</p>

<p>West had asked Mrs. White, the post trader&#8217;s
wife, if she would kindly take care of Miss
Fletcher until he should be able to return for
her. Bess, utterly exhausted, permitted herself
to be led into the dark, cool sitting-room of the
hotel. Tenderly Mrs. White unfastened her
jacket, removed her fluffy tam and brushed back
the soft brown hair. &#8220;You poor dear,&#8221; said Mrs.
White sympathetically.</p>

<p>Bess threw her aching arms about the little
woman&#8217;s neck and wept her tired heart out. Now
that it was all over and she could relax, nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
opened the floodgates of pent-up feeling and healing
tears flowed.</p>

<p>Mrs. White, seeing that the girl was physically
exhausted, as well as under a great mental
strain, led her over to the couch. She knew better
than to speak to her now, and held her tenderly
in her arms till at last only little sobs
escaped the girl, and soon her head sank low
upon the broad shoulders in sleep. Quietly Mrs.
White laid her upon the couch, placed a cover
over her, and left her to sleep. The woman came
into the room every few minutes to see if she
were still asleep, and when at sundown Henry
West returned with the buckboard for her, Bess
was still sleeping.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not waken her, Mrs. White,&#8221; he said,
gently. &#8220;I will wait until she has had her sleep
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he went into another room, where he
gave the little woman all the details of the Davis
accident. His praise of Bess and the assistance
which she gave was great indeed, and the heart
of Mrs. White went out to the sleeping stranger,
whose first experience of the Western life had
been such a trying one. They were to become
the closest of friends, and Mrs. White already
felt an indescribable affinity for the girl.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<span class="medium"><em>HW</em> RANCH</span></h2>


<p>The drive through the cool of the early evening
to the ranch, which lay only three miles from
the trading post, fully awakened and refreshed
Bess. She was longing to ask the reticent man
by her side a hundred questions regarding the
injured one, but she refrained, intuitively feeling
that she would be touching a heart-wound.
The slight hesitancy of the lariat, the sudden outburst
of passion, revealed to her woman&#8217;s instinct
the secret hatred of Henry West, which all his
sympathy and tenderness afterward could not
hide.</p>

<p>At last he spoke: &#8220;Mother will not have dinner
until we return. You must be nearly famished,
for Mrs. White told me that you had fallen
asleep before she could offer you any refreshment.
I cannot tell you how sorry I am that
you should have experienced such an ordeal.
Mr. Da&#8212;&#8212; the Agent,&#8221; he said, with a marked
effort at composure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span> &#8220;has been made comfortable,
and when I left the ranch to come after you,
mother said he had fallen asleep. My mother,
years ago, had a thorough course of training in
professional nursing, and the knowledge has
been invaluable to her. The doctors at the agency
or at the mission are so far away that in
emergency cases she is always sought. I sent
one of the men after a physician, but he can do
no more than mother has already done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is my home, Miss Fletcher,&#8221; he continued,
as they came in sight of the ranch. &#8220;How
I love it! I hope you may be contented and
happy as long as it is to be your home and
James&#8217;.&#8221; True hospitality sounded in his deep
voice and shone from his now grave yet friendly
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Thank you, Mr. West. Anyone who
could not find both happiness and contentment
amid all this beauty would be very hard to please.
It will be the first real home I have ever known&#8212;nearly
all my life has been spent at school. Dear
me! I expect you think I should have unlimited
knowledge,&#8221; she added lightly.</p>

<p>She gazed with interest about her. There
stood the large, square, white house, with its
wide porches and many windows, within a
stone&#8217;s throw of the deep, blue water of Flathead
Lake. Up the hill a short distance from
the house in a clump of willows was a magnificent
spring, whose cool, crystal water was made
to flow down to the house and into the corral.
Great barns, hay sheds and granaries were back
of the house, and comfortable poultry houses
and roomy ice-houses were also to be seen. Even
a blacksmith shop with its glowing fire caught
Bess&#8217; interested gaze, and she wondered at the
completeness of the ranch and marveled at the
brains that could manage such a large and varied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
establishment. Quite near the house stood
a teepee, and Bess could not repress a smile as
Henry West told her what it was and that the
old Indian and his wife who assisted his mother
could not be induced to sleep indoors, so pitched
their teepee in the yard for their greater comfort.</p>

<p>As West drove up to the house the door
opened, and Bess was soon clasped in the arms
of his mother. Happily he watched her as she
welcomed the sister of his dearest and best
friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. West,&#8221; said the stranger, &#8220;I cannot tell
you how happy I am to know you. James has
told me so many dear, sweet things of you that
somehow it feels as if you were my own mother,
and I do need a mother so,&#8221; added the girl, with
eyes that could not hold back the tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;God bless you, my dear,&#8221; she heard a gentle
voice saying. &#8220;I, too, need a daughter to fill the
place made vacant nearly a year ago.&#8221; She lifted
the girl&#8217;s face tenderly with both her hands,
and looking into the clear eyes told her how
much she seemed like the daughter who had been
lost.</p>

<p>&#8220;Helen was fair,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;Her hair
was even lighter than yours, dear; she was quite
as tall and about your age. She was like her
Scotch father, while Henry looks like me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bess gently kissed the tear-stained cheek of
the tender mother, and pressed her lips against
the soft, white hair, as together they went into
the house. How cozy everything seemed! The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
cheerful fire in the grate, the comfortable chairs
and couches, the beautiful pictures and rugs,
gave everything a &#8216;homey&#8217; look. Bess was surprised
to find such evidences of refinement,
wealth and comfort here&#8212;away out in Montana
and on an Indian Reservation! Her surprises
were not to end here, however, for she would
soon discover that many, many of the families
scattered all over this vast reservation were
equally as comfortable and thrifty.</p>

<p>Mrs. West led the way to Bess&#8217; room, and
telling her that dinner would be ready in a half
hour, left her.</p>

<p>Little ejaculations of happy surprises escaped
the girl as she glanced about the room. Everything
was creamy white and pale blue. The
large brass bed was draped with soft blue and
white, the furniture was white, and several comfortable
willow rockers invited to rest. In one
corner was a wide couch with numerous pretty
cushions. A few choice pictures adorned the
walls. Surely, the one who displayed so much
taste in fitting up this dainty room must have
been used to refinement! It was so different
from what she had expected to find. James had
told her of it all, and yet she was surprised. She
surmised this had been Helen&#8217;s room.</p>

<p>As she hurried about, getting on her fresh,
clean clothes, she continued her appraisal of her
room. &#8220;I love you already,&#8221; she kept saying to
herself.</p>

<p>During dinner not a word had been said concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the patient, and Bess was interested in
hearing James and Henry discussing the affairs
of the ranch&#8212;how the wheat was growing, what
a wonderful crop of hay was promised, the
oats, too, never stood so well before at this time
of year; the spring calves were all getting along
fine; up to date there had been, as nearly as could
be counted, about ninety colts.</p>

<p>Several times the girl became so engrossed
in these new, strange topics that she forgot her
meal, and Mrs. West could scarcely refrain a
smile at her wide, wondering eyes.</p>

<p>As Bess&#8217; hostess arose from the table she
said: &#8220;You must all be worn out with your experience
of today, and I advise early hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>Henry came over to his mother&#8217;s side, and
kissing her gently on the brow, told her that he
would spend the night looking after Mr. Davis.</p>

<p>But she said: &#8220;No, dear, you go to bed and
rest, and when I need you I will call you.&#8221; Finally
she persuaded him to consent to retire, after
he and James had had their smoke.</p>

<p>Bess&#8217; heart went out to this great, dark man,
as she saw his gentleness. She thought that any
man who so reverenced his mother must be
worthy of greatest confidence and trust.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say good-night now,&#8221; she said, for she
was glad to get some rest. Her face and neck
were smarting from the unusual exposure to the
sun and wind, and she was trying to find something
with which to alleviate the burning when
Mrs. West tapped gently at her door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Are you asleep, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bess quickly opened the door for her to enter.
&#8220;Mr. Davis is sleeping again, so I came to see
what help I might be to our &#8216;little stranger,&#8217;&#8221; she
said gently, and noticing that the girl was suffering
with the sunburned tender face, hastened to
bring something to soothe her. &#8220;Let me put this
on, dearie. Why, you are dreadfully burned!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have known better than to ride so
far with only that tam-o&#8217;-shanter on my head,&#8221;
said Bess.</p>

<p>&#8220;You should have a light, soft sombrero, and
then you will be a regular &#8216;cowboy,&#8217; and we&#8217;ll try
to find a gun and spurs, too,&#8221; laughed Mrs. West,
as she gently bathed the flaming cheeks and
brow.</p>

<p>When she had been tucked snugly in her bed,
Mrs. West sat by her side, telling in her modulated
voice of her own strange experiences in the
West; of her days in school and college; of her
teaching and her music; of her home life and
her children; opening little secret chambers in
her soul to the girl, who was already filling her
heart. Bess listened in wonderment at all that
was told so modestly, and then she readily understood
the source and cause of the taste and refinement
which she had already observed.</p>

<p>On they chatted, like two school chums who
had not seen each other for years, until Mrs.
West noticed the tired eyelids trying so hard to
stay open, and kissed Bess gently on the brow.
The girl aroused herself and said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span> &#8220;Please, little
mother, wait until I pray. Put your arms
around me tight and let me feel what it means
to have a mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>Together they mingled their supplications to
the Great Common Father, and in the sight of
God they were equal&#8212;though one pair of eyelids
closed on cheeks fair as a lily and tears wet the
face of one so dark.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<span class="medium">&#8220;I WOULD HAVE DONE MORE FOR AN INJUN&#8221;</span></h2>


<p>With the twitter of birds outside and glorious
sunshine streaming through the opened window,
Bess awoke early, feeling that the refreshing
sleep had completely restored her energy and
light-heartedness. She breathed deeply of the
fresh, cold air, feeling as if she could fly with the
birds.</p>

<p>The thought of helping with breakfast
prompted her to hasten, and soon she found the
kitchen. An Indian woman was busily engaged
getting the meal, as Bess entered, and she inquired
of the woman where Mrs. West was. A
slight motion of the hand upward was the only
reply, and the woman silently moved out of the
room.</p>

<p>Bess did not understand, and left the house
for out-of-doors. At a little distance stood Henry
West. Bess ran toward him with a cheerful
&#8220;Good morning! Are you quite rested, Mr.
West?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, indeed! It takes more than a day
like yesterday to tire me. But may I ask how
you are feeling this morning? You look well
and happy, surely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am, and completely rested, too; but my
face still smarts,&#8221; she replied, cautiously touching
the pretty cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;You will suffer a good deal from the sun
and wind for a while, then they won&#8217;t have any
ill effects at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not after I get thoroughly toughened, you
mean,&#8221; she said with a merry twinkle in her
eye. &#8220;Please, have we time to walk up there
to the spring, before breakfast, Mr. West?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I think so,&#8221; he replied, and led her to
the willows bending gently over, as if to hide
their treasure. Here was an immense trough
hewn from a log, where the clear, cold water
flowed through it, in a great stream.</p>

<p>Bess stooped to drink; when she lifted her
dripping face, Henry West could not suppress a
laugh at the picture she made. Even her stray
locks had had a bath, and her brown eyes were
alight like a water nymph&#8217;s. His heart swelled
with increasing love for this beautiful girl, and
with the love grew a most bitter anguish as he
realized more and more how hopeless it all must
be. He fought hard to stifle his tender passion,
and fully aware of the pain he must bear to be
so near her day after day, to see her so unconsciously
happy, to hear her merry laugh and soft,
tender voice. He could at least seek solace away
across the hills, or comfort in the company of
his faithful Eagle, whose confiding ear had already
heard many of his master&#8217;s heartaches.</p>

<p>His mother summoned them from the house,
and Bess, with a girlish challenge that she
would reach there first, started to run swiftly
down the gentle slope towards the house. Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
West caught the rosy, merry laughing girl in her
arms as she said, &#8220;I am glad to see you feeling
so well and rested this morning, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I feel fine,&#8221; Bess replied. &#8220;I want to
cry out&#8212;to shout,&#8221; she added, as she gave the
older woman so vigorous a hug that it made her
gasp for breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great guns! Bess, you better vent some of
that superfluous squeeze on some of the rest of
us. See! Mrs. West is still struggling to
breathe,&#8221; said James, as he placed Bess in her
chair at the breakfast table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so sorry, little Mother! Did I really
hurt you? But I just had to squeeze someone or
something; so after this when any of you see
me coming with fire in my eye, I give you all
fair warning.&#8221; They laughed at her strenuosity
and good spirits and the coffee was served.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bess, don&#8217;t impress those people that you
came from the Bowery,&#8221; said her brother, and all
through breakfast she tried to recall what she
had said or done that should suggest such a
thought to James.</p>

<p>Breakfast was nearly over when Mrs. West
told Henry to go up to the sick man&#8217;s room, as
Mr. Davis had requested to see him. Henry
shot a troubled glance at his mother and said,
&#8220;I would much rather not go, mother.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot understand, Henry, why you have
taken such a dislike to Mr. Davis; he has always
treated us with courtesy and many times has
shown us marked consideration. Surely you
cannot have forgotten how attentive he always
was to Helen&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, Mother! I will go to him at once.
No, I have not forgotten anything,&#8212;and pray
you may never understand,&#8221; he added in a whisper.
He arose abruptly from his chair and
quitted the room before he had finished speaking,
so the last words reached the ears of Bess
alone.</p>

<p>She watched the man, and thought of his
words the day before when she told him that she
knew Mr. Davis. As he had not asked how nor
where she had known him, she thought perhaps
James had explained.</p>

<p>Henry West knocked softly at the door of Mr.
Davis&#8217; room and entered at a faint &#8220;come in.&#8221;
He could not help feeling a twinge of pity as he
saw the pallid brow and hands of the helpless
man, and yet his very presence filled him with
ever-increasing hatred and contempt. He put
his hand to his throat as if his collar were choking
him, as he said in a husky voice: &#8220;You sent
for me, Mr. Davis. Of what service can I be to
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He could scarcely catch the faint words that
came from the injured man&#8217;s lips, and going nearer,
bent over that he might hear what Davis was
saying.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you send one of my policemen here,
West? There are several important matters
which I must see about today.&#8221; The Indian
agent spoke with effort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I fear you are not strong enough to see
anyone yet,&#8221; Henry suggested kindly.</p>

<p>The man glared at him and hotly said, &#8220;Oh,
hell! Yes, I am! All that hurts is my ankle, and
I don&#8217;t have to talk with that.&#8221;</p>

<p>With an abrupt, &#8220;Very well, sir,&#8221; West
moved towards the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, West,&#8221; said Davis, raising his voice;
&#8220;I know you didn&#8217;t give me that help yesterday
because you love me,&#8221; with a slight sneer,&#8212;&#8220;but
I thank you just the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>West suddenly wheeled and stood for a moment,
rigid with clenched hands, looking at the
man. &#8220;No, Dave Davis,&#8221; he said in his low, firm
voice, &#8220;I did not save your neck because I even
respect you. I would have done as much, or even
more, for any old Injun.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bess met him as he went through the living-room,
but he did not look at her as he passed outdoors.
She wondered what could be the reason
for his looking so sullen as he passed, and knew
that it must be the man upstairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come here a moment, dear,&#8221; called Mrs.
West to her; &#8220;I want you to take some breakfast
up to Mr. Davis. One of my women is sitting
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bess dreaded meeting him, yet she could not
refuse to go. She carried the dainty and appetizing
food into his room, and entered so softly
that the man did not move. She thought he had
fallen asleep, when a slight groan told her she
was mistaken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Here is your breakfast, Mr. Davis,&#8221; she
said cheerily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it is you, Miss Fletcher! I had begun
to wonder why you did not come to see your
patient.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do hope you are better this morning, and
that you may soon be strong again,&#8221; she said,
beginning to help him with his meal.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid this confounded ankle won&#8217;t
be in any hurry getting well,&#8221; he replied bitterly,
&#8220;and I shall be obliged to force my unwelcome
presence here for too long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t say that, Mr. Davis; I am sure
you are perfectly welcome here. Mrs. West is
only too glad to do all she can to alleviate your
pain,&#8221; reassured Bess hastily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I understand,&#8221; he replied, as he sipped
his coffee, &#8220;but Henry West has some sort of a
grudge against me. Guess he thinks that at one
time I cared for his sister.&#8221; Bess noticed a swift,
sneering smile flit across his lips. He continued:
&#8220;One never knows what to expect from these
Indians.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;S&#8212;sh,&#8221; warned Bess, glancing at the servant.
She did not like what he was saying nor
the tone of his voice, and as soon as he had finished
his breakfast she hurriedly left him. Could
the cause of all of Henry&#8217;s hatred be the sister
whom he had loved so tenderly, she wondered.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<span class="medium">BESS LEARNS THE REAL CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT</span></h2>


<p>The girl had begun to tidy up the living-room
and the pretty library, with its shelves of
choice books, when Mrs. West came in to remonstrate.
&#8220;There are plenty of hands to do those
tasks, Miss Bess,&#8221; she said, as she held the girl&#8217;s
hands in her own. &#8220;You just go out and enjoy
yourself, dear. It is such a pretty day that it
is a pity to stay indoors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please let me help you, Mrs. West,&#8221;
pleaded Bess, &#8220;for I do enjoy working; and then,
too, with your increased family you will be overtaxed.&#8221;
The girl spoke with such earnestness
that Mrs. West relented, thinking perhaps Bess
would feel more at home if she assumed some
little responsibilities. &#8220;You see,&#8221; Bess explained,
&#8220;my father insisted upon the nuns at the convent
teaching me all kinds of housework and serving,
and it has been a great source of comfort to me
to feel that I need not be dependent upon anyone
to do these tasks for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. West&#8217;s eyes followed the girl as she continued
her task quietly and quickly, all the while
busily talking.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be surprised, little Mother, when I
tell you that I have made nearly all of my own
clothes. You&#8217;ll let me help you sew, too, wo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>n&#8217;t
you? It must be a great problem for you to find
anyone here, is it not?&#8221;</p>

<p>The deft fingers were putting little touches
here and there, now arranging a vase of flowers
or moving a picture, and Mrs. West noted with
pleasure how soon the room bore evidence of her
artistic taste.</p>

<p>As the days succeeded each other and the
girl grew more and more into the home life of the
ranch, she became a help and consolation to Mrs.
West, in a thousand different ways. She relieved
her of many little duties and assumed so
willingly and competently the many cares that
ere long Mrs. West began wondering how she
had ever been able to get along without Bess, or
how she had ever had the time or strength to look
after the house alone. She now found time to
rest and to read. She even took up her practice
again, and many were the delightful hours which
she and Bess spent together with their music.
The lonely place in her heart was being filled by
the presence of this sweet, lovable girl, and her
tender, motherly love went out to Bess, as if the
girl were indeed her own daughter.</p>

<p>The visitor was considerate of everyone. She
was always seeing some kind thing to do or
gentle word to say, and everyone, including the
old Indians, who frequently came to the ranch,
was treated with respect and given a kindly
smile. Before the autumn had come her figure,
riding on Mauchacho, sometimes with James or
Henry West, or often alone, grew so familiar that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the Indians named her &#8220;Bright Eyes,&#8221; because
of the happy face and beautiful eyes.</p>

<p>Those first few weeks at the ranch were full
of pleasure and delight for Bess. She took long
rides of exploration over the vast acres, and
each time, upon her return to the house, told
of the wonderful things which she had discovered.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is the dearest spot up along the Lake
shore,&#8221; she told Mrs. West one afternoon as
she and Mauchacho came up to the porch, returning
from one of their pleasant rides. &#8220;It is
up on a little knoll, with beautiful pine trees
that looked as if they had been freshly scrubbed
this very day; and such very comfortable rocks
and logs lying about. I am going to take my
crayons and sketch there some day. Such a
magnificent view of the vast blue lake, the mountains
all around and Wild Horse Island in the
distance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, as if she felt half guilty for leaving,
she inquired how Mr. Davis seemed. &#8220;Really, I
should not have left you to take care of him so
long alone. I&#8217;ll be in the house in a moment,
little Mother, and relieve you.&#8221;</p>

<p>As none of the men were about Bess unsaddled
her horse and turned him loose to bury
his nose in the soft, green grass of the pasture.
She stood a moment watching Mauchacho as he
sniffed to find a good place to roll. &#8220;Over Mauchacho,
over again, two hundred! three hundred
dollars; good, but we won&#8217;t sell you for a thousand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
will we, you beauty?&#8221; And with her hat
and gloves she ran into the house and hurriedly
dressed to take charge of the sick man.</p>

<p>Davis had proved a quiet patient during his
confinement and was now sitting up most of the
day and soon would be able to be removed to his
quarters at the agency. In his secret heart he
knew that he was in no hurry to go; perhaps,
had he made an effort, he could have gone some
days ago. But he could not tear himself away
from the girl who had helped to alleviate his
suffering, and whose sweet voice had charmed
him when she read during the long, tedious
hours, and thrilled him while she sang, he lying
quietly and watching her face, songs that were
simple and sweet and full of deepest melody.
But she always appeared abstracted; her brown
eyes did not see the things about her, but gazed
upon unknown visions which only her heart saw.
Sometimes the brightest smiles played upon her
lips and lighted up her face with joy; again,
tear-drops hung on her long lashes, and fell unheeded
upon her hands.</p>

<p>If he could only divine the thoughts which
caused her emotion! He could not, but was entranced
and deeply moved. Was he growing to
love this girl, he asked himself a dozen times a
day. No, surely he was not. But, even if he
were, did he dare? Could he, Dave Davis, make
this beautiful, unsuspecting and pure child love
him? Always, he would banish the thought, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
he still possessed a conscience, and could not
think of her in this relation without a twinge.</p>

<p>Today as she came into the sick-room, all
rosy and fresh after her ride, he looked at her
with admiration. She had never looked half so
charming to him before; the simple white dress
made her girlish, and the bunch of yellow blossoms
thrust into the loose knot of brown hair,
just behind her ear, gave her a saucy air. She
was brushing the hair from her brow as she approached
the chair in which he was sitting.</p>

<p>&#8220;I envy you your ride and the fresh air, Miss
Fletcher. It seems ages since I felt my horse
under me. I never shall forgive him for stepping
in a hole that day. Guess if I had not been so
intent watching the girl in the distance,&#8221; he
spoke as to himself, &#8220;trying to assure myself it
was Miss Fletcher, he would not have thrown
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Davis! I hope I was not even the
unconscious cause of your accident,&#8221; Bess replied
anxiously. &#8220;Are girls such a rare sight
on the reservation that even horses run away
when they see them?&#8221; she added, half jokingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&#8212;girls like you are, yes,&#8221; he replied,
meaningly, but the girl would not understand.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I am well and able to ride, will you
let me show you some of the interesting places
on the reserve? We&#8217;ll visit the Mission, with
its school of Indians, and the church.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I should be happy to go. Thank you,
Mr. Davis; but I fear I cannot wait, for Henry
and James have planned to go with me to the
Mission next Sunday, and we expect to be there
for mass. I can scarcely wait, and know the
trip will be full of interest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Henry West seems to take quite a good deal
of your time,&#8221; he said pettishly, and Bess
wrinkled her brow, amused at his displeasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me finish the book,&#8221; suggested Bess,
but the man said he was tired and would prefer
to rest. She regretted his petulant mood, and
quietly left the room.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<span class="medium">&#8220;HELEN&#8221; AT ST. IGNATIUS MISSION</span></h2>


<p>Oh! the rarity of that early June morning
when a trio of happy beings mounted their eager
horses. The dawn was still in the east, where
roseate clouds hung soft and low on the crests
of the mountains. In the shadows the blueness
of the fleeing night still lingered. The air was
unusually soft for the early hour and birds twittered
to arouse their tardy nest-mates.</p>

<p>The tamaracks were now the softest, tenderest
green, and in the dawning light seemed like
soft billows of sea foam which had been flung
through the miles of space and caught in the outstretched
arms of the tall monarchs of the hills.
It was only a little after five o&#8217;clock, but the
long ride of twenty-five miles to St. Ignatius
Mission demanded an early start, so that the
horses might be well rested before returning to
<em>HW</em> ranch.</p>

<p>Henry West was cramming into the pockets
of his mackinaw what later proved to be some
appetizing sandwiches; for he knew Fletcher&#8217;s
returning health and vigor caused insatiable demand
for &#8220;grub.&#8221; Mrs. West had thoughtfully
prepared the lunch as they were hurrying to get
started. Now she stood in the open doorway,
smiling good-byes to her family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Bess looked beautifully charming in her well-fitted
jacket and divided skirt of reseda green.
A filmy white veil was tied over her sombrero
and floated over her shoulder in long loops like
a fleecy cloud nestling against her soft, brown
tresses. At her throat showed the soft whiteness
of her shirt waist, for, &#8220;was it not Sunday, and
were they not going to church, and ought they
not to be dressed in their best?&#8221; she argued when
James asked why she had not worn her corduroy
suit for the long, dusty ride. Bess wished secretly
that she, too might wear the leathern
&#8220;chapps&#8221; like the boys; as they seemed so much
more comfortable than a lot of useless cloth
about one. She vowed inwardly that some day,
when no one was looking, she would try the
&#8220;chapps,&#8221; and if they proved satisfactory why
should she not wear them too?</p>

<p>The horses made good time at a steady gait,
and all were so preoccupied that only a few desultory
remarks were exchanged. As the miles
grew in number the dawn became brighter and
brighter, till now old Sol shot forth his streaming
gold and a new and glorious day began.</p>

<p>&#8220;This will be a very warm day,&#8221; remarked
Henry West, after a deliberate survey of the
sky. &#8220;It feels like a weather-breeder and I think
we&#8217;ll have a heavy rain by night.&#8221; He unfastened
his mackinaw, and the breeze blew out his
soft, white, silk shirt in little fat puffs.</p>

<p>They passed groups of fine, sleek cattle and
horses, the <em>HW</em> brand being the most conspicuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
among them. Suddenly Henry West gave
Eagle a swift turn on the bridle and sped across
the grass till he came upon some strange calves.
From the distance intervening Bess and James
watched him wonderingly and with interest.
When he returned to them his face was lowering.
James was about to ask what was wrong, but
thought if it were anything of interest to him
that Henry would tell him.</p>

<p>On and on they rode, now in a swift gallop,
for the road was smooth and hard, and by this
time the horses had their &#8220;second wind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bess&#8217; inquisitiveness got the better of her,
and she cried: &#8220;For pity&#8217;s sake, Henry, do tell
me what is wrong! Can&#8217;t you see I&#8217;m just bursting
to know?&#8221; And she gave her contumacious
hair a vigorous thrust under her sombrero.</p>

<p>West began slowly: &#8220;James, in your riding
over the range, have you noticed among any of
my cows a scrub, measly-looking red bull? Those
calves, back there, show his ear-marks. Last
year I told old Savaeau that if he did not kill
that damned nuisance I would the first chance I
got. And here this season&#8217;s calves are again
contaminated by scrub breeding.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bess had grown so accustomed to hearing
discussions of all kinds concerning the cattle
and horses that she was deeply interested, and
now, before James had time to reply, she spoke:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know that about three days ago when
I was going over to Polson I came across several
of your cows and a most terrible looking animal
with them! He had a big head like a buffalo,
and a dreadful hump; the rest of him looked
like&#8212;well, like&#8212;just cow. Is that the one you
are looking for?&#8221; She was surprised and hurt
at the look the boys gave each other, and then
roars and peals of laughter rent the air.</p>

<p>Bess&#8217; cheeks flamed up red and hot, and she
gave Mauchacho a cut across the flanks which
caused him to leap forward in surprise, and he
sped like a streak down the winding road and
out of sight behind a low hill. Tears sprang into
the girl&#8217;s eyes, not so much perhaps at the exchanged
glances and laughter, as at the thought
that perhaps her unsolicited interest had been
misconstrued. She now quietly checked Mauchacho
and hastily pulled off her jacket. She
brushed her wet cheeks with her sleeve in her
haste to appear nonchalant to the approaching
horsemen, whom she could hear hastening after
her. To her dismay, she discovered that her
immaculate sleeve was now all grimy and dust-streaked
and knew that her face too must be
streaked with dirt. Luckily she had just reached
a stream of clear, cold water, and she slipped off
her horse and was already bathing her face when
Henry West reached her.</p>

<p>He stood silently behind her, watching the
lithe, graceful girl, as she bent down to kiss the
stream. She glanced over her shoulder, her face
dripping with the cool water, her hair wet and
falling over her eyes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;I did not cry&#8212;so there&#8212;you need not look
so sorry,&#8221; she said, with half pouting lips that
could no longer resist the pulsates of her happy
nature, and involuntarily she burst into a merry
laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am really sorry to have been so rude as to
laugh at your remarks, Miss Fletcher,&#8221; West
was saying, and again he tried in vain to restrain
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up, Sister; fall in the creek?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I was just trying to drown my sorrow
when this gentleman interfered and I took a
drink instead,&#8221; Bess replied facetiously, and
when they again resumed their journey each was
light-hearted once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please tell me, James, what was the thing
I tried to describe, will you?&#8221; Bess asked, as she
and James had fallen behind Eagle for a little
way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, that was a cattelo, which is part
buffalo and part cow. They are rather dreadful
looking creatures, to be sure, and I can&#8217;t see
why West raises them, unless because the hides
are valuable, and perhaps the meat has a rare
flavor.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was now after eight o&#8217;clock and West said
that they would soon come in sight of St. Ignatius.
A short distance ahead of them walked
a hurrying priest. One hand tightly clasped a
prayer book, while the other tried in vain to
lift the already begrimed cassock out of the
dust. The boys lifted their sombreros in salutation,
and to Bess&#8217; cheery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> &#8220;Good morning,
Father,&#8221; the priest gave her a smile and a &#8220;God
bless you.&#8221;</p>

<p>At last they saw the beautiful grounds of the
Mission, with its church spire and the roofs of
the many buildings, interspersed with the trees,
whose fresh, green foliage was invitingly cool.
The sun had grown unusually warm for early
morning and eagerly the girl reined her horse
in the refreshing shadows of the trees.</p>

<p>The bell suddenly pealed forth, and they
hastened to dismount. West cared for the horses
and James led Bess into the beautiful little
church. The sight that met their eyes was
strange to Eastern eyes. Indians knelt with
their bright-colored blankets wrapped closely
about them. The candles fluttered on the altar
profusely covered with early spring flowers.
James sought the Wests&#8217; pew and led his sister
there. As she sunk on her knees to pray the
organ sounded and in marched the somberly-clad
nuns, followed by the many Indian children who
were attending school. The entire service passed
like a dream to Bess; and she was often distracted
watching the children at their prayers,
listening to their sweet, untrained voices in the
choir, or analyzing some Indian, stoically moving
his lips in prayer.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mea culpa, mea culpa</i>&#8212;&#8221; murmured Bess,
half audibly, as she heard others striking their
breasts; and she half turned to see if Henry
West had yet come into the seat beside them. He
was not there, nor did he come.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span> &#8220;He is perhaps
in the rear,&#8221; thought Bess. It was not long till
they knelt for the blessing, and soon all were
filing out of the church. Bess left James at the
door, saying she wished to wander through the
gardens.</p>

<p>What a profusion of blooming shrubs! The
air was sweet with the fruit blossoms, and all
along the paths were wonderfully fragrant
pansies, violets, and other early flowers. Near
the church was the cemetery with its numerous
white-painted crosses. As Bess looked through
the enclosure she was attracted by an imposing
monument, and, curious to learn what distinguished
person had found his last resting place
here, she entered God&#8217;s Acre. As she neared the
grave she saw Henry West kneeling in the
shadow of the monument, his face buried in his
arm as he leaned against the stone. Bess suddenly
halted. Never in her life had she beheld
such despair. Either he had heard her approach
or intuitively felt she was near, for without lifting
his head he stretched forth a hand to her.
She could not resist the appeal. She grasped his
hard and swarthy hand, and unconsciously
clasped it to her breast.</p>

<p>In a moment a face, pale and drawn, was
raised to meet her sympathetic gaze. He tried to
speak, but could utter no word. Releasing his
hand he pointed slowly to the tiny cross at his
feet.</p>

<p>Bess dropped to her knees and read the word
<span class="small">HELEN</span>. That was all. That was enough. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
could cold, hard words tell of her who was sleeping
there? &#8220;Helen,&#8221; the world might read, and
perhaps give a sigh. &#8220;Helen,&#8221; the man now read,
and his heart yearned for his dear, lost sister
and for the love that had been torn from him.
What idle print could show the grief and misery
that had broken that young heart?</p>

<p>&#8220;Helen&#8221; was all Bess saw, and yet intuitively
she read pages of love, sacrifice, heartaches, hope,
pain and glory. She arose, and impulsively placing
both her hands against the dark man&#8217;s face,
she said in a whisper of sympathy, &#8220;Henry&#8212;Henry!
Why cannot I be your sister? Let me
fill her place in your heart! Let me take up the
broken thread and finish the weaving! Can I?
May I?&#8221;</p>

<p>My God! What was she saying! What had
he heard? &#8220;Henry, Henry&#8221; rang in the man&#8217;s
ears, sweeter than any music. She had spoken
his name, now, today; and how he had longed to
hear her lips frame that homely word. He re-caught
the echo of her appeal. It was not love
that prompted her then; it was only pity. Were
love and pity akin? When he could collect his
thoughts sufficiently to reply he clasped both
her hands in his own for a brief moment. Then
he stepped back and flung up his head. With set
jaws he said, in such a low voice that Bess leaned
forward on the tiny marble cross to catch the
words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span> &#8220;I could not go into the church&#8212;I could
not pray while hatred tore my heart in pieces&#8212;I
could not forget her&#8212;her misery&#8212;I stayed here
near her&#8212;to tell her again she shall be aven&#8212;&#8221;
Hastily collecting himself and smothering his
passion, he continued, &#8220;Thank you, little girl&#8212;Bess,
I may now say; thank you for your sympathy
and your pity. I know you are sincere,
but somehow&#8212;somehow&#8212;there is still a void
here,&#8221; as he clutched at his pounding heart.
&#8220;Your words do not suffice&#8212;they cannot, will
not. No, only she&#8212;Helen&#8212;could be a sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>Had Bess not been so unsophisticated she
would have understood the subtle meaning of his
words. As it was, she only felt her unworthiness,
and was sorry her impulsive nature had thrust
itself forward.</p>

<p>For a moment there was an awkward silence,
which Henry West relieved: &#8220;Come, I will show
you about the grounds and buildings. James is
visiting with Father Damien, over there near
the church,&#8221; and he led the silent girl away.</p>

<p>Presently they were viewing with interest
all the beauties of the place. Here were fine,
substantial, brick school buildings, one for the
girls and another for the boys, where they were
taught all useful and instructive arts. The broad
fields were in a high state of cultivation, and
the trees of the orchard gave promise of an
abundant harvest, so laden were they with lingering
blossoms and fast-forming fruit. This
seemed to be the very choicest bit of the reservation,
where years and years ago came the Jesuit
priests, and where, during all this time, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
had labored zealously for the temporal and spiritual
welfare of the Indian children.</p>

<p>Seated in a wheel chair, in a sunny exposure
of the garden, they came upon a black-robed nun
with another nun standing near her. As Bess
and Henry West approached the one turned to
meet them. What a dear, young face was that
which upturned to meet Bess&#8217; interested look.
What an expression of human understanding
lighted up the deep blue eyes, as the girl said to
her, &#8220;Good morning, Sister; are you enjoying
God&#8217;s beautiful sunshine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dear; Sister Mary Joseph can scarcely
be inveigled indoors now that the sun is becoming
so fervent. Well! Well!&#8221; the nun interrupted,
&#8220;if here isn&#8217;t Henry West! See! Sister
Mary Joseph, who has honored us with a visit
today!&#8221;</p>

<p>Henry West stepped forward holding his sombrero
in his hands. &#8220;This is Miss Bess Fletcher,
James&#8217; sister;&#8221; he said, &#8220;and Bess, this is Sister
Mary Joseph, and Sister Agnes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bess bent over the aged nun, who, with difficulty,
lifted her hand. But, although the face
was lined and seamed by the hand of time and
the hardships of frontier life, the smiles of welcome
and greeting were made of that kind of
woof and warp which never show the ravages of
age. Henry explained, &#8220;Sister Mary Joseph has
been here ever since 1865, and has seen all the
vicissitudes of St. Ignatius Mission.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bess longed to hear the dear old woman relate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
some of the wonderful experiences which
she had seen and in which she herself had been
an important factor, but the bell was calling for
the second mass, and as Sister Agnes was just
then relieved from her duty by another nun, she
asked Bess to accompany her to the church and
sing.</p>

<p>Henry West had gone on and joined James at
the door.</p>

<p>At the offertory Bess sang Mascagni&#8217;s <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ave
Maria</i>, and as her soft, glorious voice arose and
fell in beautiful tone waves, even Father Damien
and the Indians held their breath for fear of losing
a sound.</p>

<p>When Bess had finished Sister Agnes kissed
her cheek, and left the imprint of her own wet
one.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<span class="medium">A WESTERN TRAGEDY</span></h2>


<p>&#8220;After all, we have not gained much by staying
at the Mission over night, for another storm
is coming and we better hurry to some place of
shelter or we shall all be drenched to the skin,&#8221;
remarked Henry West, as he casually glanced
over his shoulder toward the Southwestern
horizon, where an ominous looking rain-cloud
was rapidly rising. As he had predicted the
day before, a heavy rain began just as they were
about to re-saddle the horses to return to <em>HW</em>
ranch. The morning dawned soft and warm;
fresh from the washed hillsides came the ozone;
the east was filled with fiery, red clouds, which
warned them that the rain was not yet all spilled
upon the thirsty earth. How green the stretch
of grazing land looked; how verdant the distant
pines and firs, fresh from nature&#8217;s bath! The
dust in the wagon road was all gone, and now
occasionally the horses splashed with delight
through mud puddles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mauchacho, if you spatter my go-to-meeting
riding togs you&#8217;ll get your ears pulled,&#8221; Bess
said to her horse. She had not heard West&#8217;s remark
regarding the weather for she was in an
abstracted mood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on a moment, boys,&#8221; she cried after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the two. They had given their horses rein,
thinking she was aware of the coming storm, and
were riding swiftly to where they might be kept
dry, for a time at least. Just then Bess noticed
the light becoming dimmed. Hastily glancing
back she saw the hurrying rain and was greeted
by a splash of heralding drops.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, so that&#8217;s the hurry! Come, Mauchacho,
it&#8217;s up to you to keep me dry and save this green
gown from making a blot on the already verdant
landscape,&#8221; she said whimsically, and the horse,
as if he understood, in haste to overtake his fleeing
companions, sped like the bird he really was
and reached the sheltering, overhanging rock
before the others.</p>

<p>As the trio dismounted each drew the reins
over his horse&#8217;s head, and so left them, where
they stood as quietly as if they were tied. Quickly
the saddles were taken off their steaming
backs and placed under the shelter of the rocks.
Bess and James were already safely out of the
rain, and the girl was impatiently jumping up
and down urging Henry West to &#8220;hurry for
pity&#8217;s sake&#8221; or else he would be drowned.</p>

<p>As West crouched under the ledge he took off
his broad hat and shook the rain from it, saying:
&#8220;These things are nearly as good as an
umbrella; aren&#8217;t they, James?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come under here closer, Henry; you are
not out of the rain yet,&#8221; said Bess. She took hold
of his arm and pulled him close to her. So they
stood, the fresh, rosy, smiling girl, with wilful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
brown tresses over her face, clinging to the dark,
stalwart man on one side and to her fair-skinned
brother on the other. Silently they watched the
rain, which fell in gusty sheets.</p>

<p>The horses had shifted and stood dejectedly
with their tails against the increasing onslaughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor old baby Mauchacho,&#8221; said Bess, tenderly;
&#8220;I wish there was room to crowd you in
here, too.&#8221; The horse replied with a knowing
wriggle of his ear, as if to say he &#8220;wished so,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, here, James, cheer up,&#8221; said the sister,
giving him a vigorous shake. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know
that behind the clouds is still the blue sky?&#8221; He
was looking nearly as lowery as the rain-clouds,
and even West came from his reverie, asking
what was the trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; said James, &#8220;this will delay us
nearly two days in rounding up the beef for that
shipment, and I doubt if the men can have them
at Selish in time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Young Fletcher had proved his mettle on the
ranch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, Jim! I&#8217;ll help, and I think we can
manage all O. K.&#8221; answered Henry West, optimistically.
&#8220;Here, Bess, sit down awhile,&#8221; he
added, quickly drawing off his mackinaw and
spreading it on the bed of pine needles. The
girl could offer no remonstrance, as he gently
placed her on the coat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think I can be comfortable here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
while I know you will get cold? You&#8217;ll surely
be ill!&#8221; She started to rise, but as he placed her
on the seat again he assured her that when he
grew cold he would ask for the coat. So she sat
with her hands clasped about her knees, and
her chin buried against them; her soft, liquid
eyes gazing longingly across the rain-dashed
landscape.</p>

<p>The men, too, grew silent, and the time
dragged. Bess gave a sigh and made a tentative
effort to rise, but a gentle, restraining hand on
her shoulder told her that though the man at her
side was silent, he was still solicitous. James,
becoming weary of standing, seated himself with
his back pressed tight against that of his sister.</p>

<p>How the thoughts began chasing each other
through the girl&#8217;s brain! Little incidents of her
girlhood days, or perhaps some memory of happy
companionship at school would cause her to
smile. Then, again, a sigh at some memory
came unconsciously from her lips; and once, as
she recalled a humorous episode, a little ripple
of laughter escaped her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Enjoying yourself, Bess?&#8221; asked James, irritably,
at her jocular outburst. &#8220;I wish this infernal
rain would let up so we could get home
some time today,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to be letting up some now,&#8221; said
West. &#8220;If you&#8217;ll let me take the mackinaw,
please, I&#8217;ll go out and take a look over the hills
and see how much longer we shall have to wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>When West had gone out into the rain, Bess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
asked her brother what time of day it was.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve been here two infernal hours,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and it is nearly noon. I wish we had some
lunch, for we&#8217;ll all be mighty hungry before we
reach the ranch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, James, don&#8217;t be cross. That won&#8217;t
drive the rain away, and it only makes us feel
more uncomfortable. Ah! Here comes the
weather man! I can tell by the looks of his face
that there is soon to be a rainbow!&#8221; cried the
girl, joyfully, as West re-entered the shelter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, the clouds are lifting, and it will soon
be safe to start. I fear you&#8217;ll suffer from the
mud, Miss Bess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be a shame to spoil this green,&#8221; she
replied, &#8220;but I fear I must bear it for my stomach&#8217;s
sake. Since James mentioned being hungry
I have developed such an alarming craving
for something to eat that it seems as if I had not
tasted food in days. Oh! I wish there were
some place where we could get our dinner!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is,&#8221; answered West; &#8220;over at Joe
Nedreau&#8217;s, about eight miles further on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Soon the rain ceased, and the men hurried
with the saddles. They picked their way carefully
through the water-soaked sod till they
reached the road, where the water was running
like miniature rivers. At first Bess tried to
guard her skirt from the muddy onslaughts, but
soon saw that her efforts were of no avail and
urged her horse into a faster gait.</p>

<p>The miles intervening between them and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
prospective meal grew less and less. West, riding
ahead, scanned the grazing herds at either
side in a desultory manner. Suddenly he
brought Eagle to a stop, raised himself up in the
stirrups, and, with his hand shading his eyes,
gazed intently across the range. Quickly he
turned. &#8220;Jim, over there near the stream is that
scrub bull of Savaeau&#8217;s! Get your rope ready
and come with me! You keep Mauchacho here,&#8221;
to the girl, who was now wide-eyed, and wondered
what was going to happen.</p>

<p>With difficulty she restrained her horse, who
was bent on following the fleeing companions.
Bess released her feet from the stirrups and
sprang quickly to the ground to hold the animal
by the bit; and by patting and talking softly to
him succeeded in quieting him.</p>

<p>Over the green expanse sped the two horsemen.
West bent low over his horse&#8217;s neck, riding
madly. A rise in the ground for a moment concealed
them, when up they shot, like two huge
birds.</p>

<p>The herd had already seen the oncoming
men, and instinctively felt that harm was approaching.
With a loud snort and his tail in
the air, the leader galloped over the range, followed
by all the other cattle. On came the
horses, now charged with excitement and knowledge
of what was coming. James swerved to the
right and artfully separated the bull from the
rest of the herd. When the creature discovered
he was divided from the other cattle, he turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
swiftly and unexpectedly, which nearly resulted
in throwing James from his horse. West had
ridden across from the herd, and with his rope
already swinging in the air would have captured
the animal then and there had he not hesitated
when he saw that James was nearly unseated.
The hesitancy gave the animal a fresh start and
on he ran and ran, ever evading his pursuers.
Snorting horses and relentless pursuers drove
him from every shelter. Each man knew that
the only way to capture him would be to tire him
out.</p>

<p>Bess was still standing at her horse&#8217;s head, engrossed
in watching the distant chase. They were
so far away that at times she could not distinguish
the men. At first she was excited, but as
she saw the persistent pursuit and the vain attempt
the animal made to reach a place of safety,
she felt a wave of indignation surge over her and
fill her with hot anger. Stamping her foot upon
the ground, she cried out in vain: &#8220;Oh, you two
horrid men! Leave that poor creature alone!
What will you do when you do capture him?
Murder him, of course! James, have you lost all
your sense, to follow that&#8212;that&#8212;Indian! Yes,
that is all you are now&#8212;an Indian thirsting for
the blood of your victim!&#8221;</p>

<p>She burst into uncontrollable tears and hid
her face against her horse&#8217;s neck, to shut out the
vision of the tragedy. Mauchacho bent his head
and touched his mistress with his nose, as if trying
to console her. Could he have spoken he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
would have explained that these things were a
part of Western life; how it was impossible to
tolerate low-bred stock; how this affair would
seem all right when she became accustomed to
the ways and laws of the range.</p>

<p>So the girl stood, for ages it seemed to her,
until she heard the approach of the horses. She
did not lift her head when they came up, and
West saw that she had been sorely affected by
witnessing the capture.</p>

<p>In a soft, low voice he said: &#8220;I&#8217;m very sorry,
Miss Bess, that this circumstance occurred just
as it did. It was unavoidable.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl wheeled, with a storm of reproof
upon her lips; but as she saw his seriousness,
her parted lips closed slowly, and she left unsaid
what she thought to say. She shuddered at the
remnant of blood stains which she saw upon his
hands and bespattered white silk shirt, and
springing into the saddle turned her horse away
with an unreasoning jerk.</p>

<p>James saw her displeasure and only aggravated
it by saying that she would grow accustomed
to such things if she stayed in the cattle
country.</p>

<p>West followed Mauchacho in silence and only
spoke when they reached the Nedreau ranch. He
hurried forward to help the girl dismount, but
she scorned his assistance and sprang lightly to
the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you&#8212;did you kill him?&#8221; she demanded,
pushing up her hair with an angry gesture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8212;I had to,&#8221; he replied, looking into her
eyes with decisive determination.</p>

<p>Just then an old Indian with his squaw came
into view. West accosted them, and by numerous
gestures and gutteral sounds explained that
down under the willows, near the creek, they
would find &#8220;heap muck-a-muck.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bess became deeply interested in the ambiguous
and incoherent conversation; saw their stoic
faces assuming a happy and expectant expression
as their benefactor impressed upon them the
fact that a supply of fresh beef was at their command.
Before West had fairly finished explaining
to them, they had started their old, wobbly
cayuses into their swiftest paces, to reach the
treasure before some other hungry &#8220;Injun&#8221; had
discovered the prize.</p>

<p>When West again looked at Bess she could
not resist a smile, and remarked that at least
some one would enjoy the spoils.</p>

<p>The man was greatly relieved at the restoration
of her good humor, and when they joined
James he informed them that in a few minutes
all could have something to eat, even the horses.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope it won&#8217;t be beef,&#8221; suggested Bess. &#8220;I
should think that you two would never dare to
look a cow in the face again.&#8221;</p>

<p>While at dinner James told his companions
a story which was positively authentic. He remembered
how, one day when he was about fifteen
years of age, several of the grades, where he
was attending school, met for the purpose of giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
jointly a Longfellow programme. Everything
went along smoothly and beautifully, and
presently he heard his teacher announce that
Miss Emma Lane would recite <cite>The Wreck of the
Hesperus</cite>. He laughed now as he recalled how
his heart thumped when the idol of his youthful
dreams arose and walked nervously to the rostrum.
In his swift yet ardent gaze at the object
of his adoration, all he remembered seeing was a
beautiful pink bow tucked snugly under a soft,
generous chin, and two hands, fingering franticly
at either side of her freshly laundered white
dress. He did not dare look again for he felt
himself too sympathetically nervous. Then he
heard a tentative, quavering voice begin&#8212;&#8220;It
was the schooner,&#8221;&#8212;a pause, a gulp, and again,
&#8220;It was the schooner,&#8221; etc., and this time the
Hesperus was fairly and swiftly launched with
the skipper and his little daughter aboard. On
sailed the craft and on sailed Emmie (&#8220;as I called
her,&#8221; James explained), both rising and falling
with the angry sea and rolling waves. With her
ever-increasing confidence he felt his own courage
returning, and presently he gazed with
mouth wide open at the fair and fat girl on the
platform. Oh, the joy he felt that she was his.
If he could meet her on the way from school that
afternoon he believed he would tell her how he
loved her and thus relieve his overburdened
heart. She, so simple, so fair, so plump (if a
trifle too short), and withal so very modest! He
did not hear a word now of the recitation,
so engrossed was he in the living poem before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
him. But, as she made a frantic, sweeping gesture,
he came back to earth with a thud as he
heard:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;The waves looked soft as carded wool;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the cruel rocks, they gored her side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the horns of an angry&#8212;cow.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Now, that settled me; that settled Emmie;
for shame, Longfellow!&#8221; concluded James, laughing
as he brought to his mind&#8217;s eye the tragedy of
that day at school. When the three were able to
resume their meal after the merriment caused
by his narrative, Bess remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;And that fatal Hesperus wrecked all his
faith in women. I have scarcely even found him
looking at one, if he could avoid it. Poor,
brokenhearted brother,&#8221; she mocked, teasingly.</p>

<p>A few days later one of West&#8217;s cowboys took
a splendid Hereford bull across the hills to old
Savaeau, with instructions for him to &#8220;stick his
iron on the animal.&#8221;</p>

<span class="medium">THE MIRACLE OF WOMANHOOD</span></h2>


<p>Dave Davis, the Indian agent, had sent word
that he wished to be removed to his quarters at
Arlee as soon now as possible. Today, the day after
Bess&#8217; return from her interesting visit to St.
Ignatius Mission, he was expecting one of his
policemen to come for him. His foot was far
from strong, but he had managed since Sunday
to hobble about with one crutch and a cane. The
past two days had been tedious and long, and he
had sorely missed the cheery presence of the girl.
How he should miss her singing and her reading!
He secretly wished he had further excuse to remain
near her; yet, on the other hand, it was
distasteful to him to be brought in contact with
West. Thus far they had seen little of each
other. Today at luncheon would be their first
meal together. Each dreaded the meeting, yet
Davis could not excuse himself, and if Henry
West was at home, he was too much of a gentleman
to allow a guest to note any displeasure.</p>

<p>Davis slowly and painfully found his way
downstairs and into the living-room, in quest of
Mrs. West, to apprise her of his expectant departure
some time during the day, and to offer, if
he might, some pecuniary settlement for all the
comforts and attentions which he had received
during his enforced stay at the <em>HW</em> Ranch.</p>

<p>No one seemed to be about, but presently he
heard, coming from another part of the house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Bess&#8217; melodious voice. Wafted to him came the
words, &#8220;And sometimes in the twilight gloom
apart&#8212;&#8221; He passed through the dining-room
and paused before the half-open door of the
kitchen. &#8220;The tall trees whisper, whisper heart
to heart,&#8221; continued the girl, all unconscious of
the alert ear at the door-casing.</p>

<p>&#8220;From my fond lips the eager answers fall&#8212;thinking&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>A pause, as Bess stopped to glance at a cookbook
which lay on a table just before her, and
into her song was woven, &#8220;(&#8216;three eggs well beaten&#8217;)
thinking I hear thee call.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she closed her lips and softly hummed
the air as she was vigorously beating a cream
mixture in a huge yellow bowl.</p>

<p>The beautiful picture which she made held
the eaves-dropper entranced, and he scarcely
breathed lest his presence be discovered and the
charming vision be gone.</p>

<p>Bess had on an immense blue and white gingham
apron, the sleeves rolled high up above her
dimpled elbows, exposing the creamy white of the
fore-arm. A line of tan about the wrist showed
that she had been thoughtless about exposing her
hands to the sun and wind. A big floppy bow of
black ribbon unsuccessfully restrained the soft
knot of hair on her neck, and her &#8220;forelock,&#8221; as
she had denominated it, lay almost directly on
her nose, all snowy white. A little unconscious
puff at the obstruction sent a tiny white cloud of
flour into the air, which elicited an audible smile
from the figure at the doorway. Bess quickly
turned and faced the visitor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Mr. Davis, aren&#8217;t you dreadful to startle
one so! The lady of the house is out,&#8221; she
said with a soft Irish twang to the words, &#8220;and
&#8217;tis against the rules an&#8217; regulations of this
household to intertain any company in the
kitchen.&#8221; She artfully caught hold of either side
of her apron and made a sweeping courtesy to
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please let me come in, little girl; I&#8217;m
lonesome; I haven&#8217;t seen you for three days, and
now you would drive me away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Davis came up to the opposite side of the
table, and presented such a pathetic, pleading
spectacle that Bess relented and permitted him to
be seated. Cautiously he sank into a chair and
tenderly rested his lame foot across the crutch.
Bess again took up the big spoon and pounded
away vigorously at the contents in the yellow
bowl, trying to cover her confusion.</p>

<p>It is trying, at best, for even an expert in the
culinary art, to be closely watched while engrossed
in the intricacies of mixing a cake; but
how much more so, when a girl has not &#8220;tried her
luck&#8221; for months, and besides, when the table,
the floor, the apron, her face, and even her hair,
bear strong circumstantial evidence that the
flour-sifter had leaked profusely. Furthermore,
one dismal failure was spread out in full, accusing
view on the table before her. Her cheeks
burned with brilliant color, and her brown eyes
flashed half nervously and half defiantly as she
wielded the spoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; began Bess, in an explanatory
voice, &#8220;Mrs. West was called to see Mrs. White,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
who is quite ill at Polson, and she gave me full
sway in the kitchen for today. Mary, the Indian
woman, is on a protracted visit to some of her
relatives, over on Dayton Creek, so I am to get
the meals. It&#8217;s great fun to come into the kitchen
and cook &#8216;just for today,&#8217; but I do not think I
should care to assume the responsibility and the
thinkability of twenty-one squares a week. I
don&#8217;t wonder that women grow desperately tired
of unceasingly hungry people to keep satisfied.&#8221;</p>

<p>On chatted the girl to the enthralled listener,
and her composure returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you trying to put your head in the
flour barrel?&#8221; laughingly inquired Davis, as he
noted the white, puffy locks.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Bess, assuming a dramatic attitude.
She quoted,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;My hair is grey, though not with years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor grew it white in a single night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As men&#8217;s have grown from sudden&#8212;&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Oh, say,&#8221; she cried, abruptly, &#8220;don&#8217;t you
love Lord Byron&#8217;s poems! <cite>The Prisoner of Chillon</cite>,
<cite>Childe Harold</cite>, <cite>Mazeppa</cite>&#8212;only that&#8217;s so
cruel!</p>

<p>&#8220;You see this,&#8221; she changed the subject.
&#8220;This which ought to be a delectation,&#8221; pointing
with scornful gesture at the remnant of the
burned and flattened cake before her on the
table; and then, giving her latest creation another
whack or two before putting it into the
baking-tin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span> &#8220;but it is only an abstraction for
which Lord Byron is to blame. I had that book
of his poems open, so that I might be committing
some of the lines while occupied in stirring the
batter, and while I was repeating,&#8212;&#8216;There were
seven pillars of Gothic mold&#8212;seven pillars of&#8217;&#8212;why,
you see, I put seven teaspoonsful of yeast
powder into the stuff and never noticed it until
I had opened the oven, and the frothy, foamy
mass went sizz-z-z&#8212;and hit bottom.&#8221;</p>

<p>Davis became convulsed at her narrative and
her manner of relating it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, sir; please do not move nor breathe for
forty minutes, and I will show you a triumph,&#8221;
commanded Bess, as she picked up the utensils
which she had used in her work.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I may speak, ever so carefully,&#8221; said
Davis, &#8220;I&#8217;d like to tell you a little experience I
had with a cake, or rather, an experience of an
old bachelor friend of mine, over east of the
range.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do go on! I&#8217;m sure it is interesting!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was this way: Bill had been living all
alone on his sheep ranch over there, and like
many western men who live lonely lives, was
rather out-spoken and uncouth, altho&#8217; true as
steel. He grew tired of just bacon and corn-dodgers
for grub, so he decided he&#8217;d try his luck
at making a cake. I happened to be riding the
range that day and went out of my way to go
over and say &#8216;How&#8217; to Bill. As I neared the
cabin a suspicious odor greeted my nostrils simultaneously
with Bill&#8217;s appearance at the door.
He had nearly as much flour over him as you
have now,&#8221; added Davis, facetiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Bess glanced at her tell-tale apron and folded
it across her lap as she sat on a low stool interested
in the cake tale.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Hello, Bill,&#8217; I called, &#8216;what&#8217;s up? Smells
to me as if you had a cook! Been getting married
and didn&#8217;t send me a card?&#8217; I said to him, as
if in earnest. &#8216;Aw hell, no, Dave, this haint no
fit place for a woman, even if I could find one
who would have such an onnery cuss as I am,&#8217; he
answered. &#8216;Better unsaddle and stop for grub;
got some swell dope &#8217;bout ready. Come in pretty
easy though &#8217;er she&#8217;ll fall.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as I crossed the threshold he had taken
a cautious peep into the tiny oven. As he lifted
his red face a radiant and expectant smile
wreathed his seamy mug, and mouth-juice
trickled down either side of his chin, anticipating
the delight to be. Presently he took me by
the arm, lead me cautiously over to the stove and
opened the oven to let me see what it contained.
&#8216;A cake, by thunder!&#8217; he said. &#8216;Ain&#8217;t she a peach,
Davy, old boy! Look at her foam! She is sure
great stuff&#8212;and&#8212;but&#8212;Gee! She&#8217;s&#8212;what&#8217;s it
doing&#8212;it&#8217;s&#8212;&#8217; and just then there was a sizz-z-z&#8212;and
&#8216;she struck bottom.&#8217; Bill&#8217;s face fell with
the cake and he banged the door with a vengeance.
For a moment he stood with his hands
thrust into his pockets, and then burst out:&#8212;&#8216;Bake&#8212;damn
ye&#8212;we&#8217;ll eat you anyhow!&#8217; &#8216;What
seems to be the trouble with it, Bill?&#8217; I asked as
consolingly as I could without roaring.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span> &#8216;She
ought to be good&#8212;I looked in the receipt book,
and the first thing I read about cakes it said&#8212;the
yelks of seven aigs&#8212;Sheep don&#8217;t lay no
aigs, so I shut the book and fixed &#8217;er up to suit
myself. I put in plenty of sugar and baking-powder
and plenty of corn-meal to give &#8217;er body.
I didn&#8217;t have no vanilly or lemon flavor, so I just
put in a squirt of Perry Davis&#8217; Pain Killer, and I
guess that&#8217;s what knocked her out.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you eat it?&#8221; asked Bess.</p>

<p>&#8220;N&#8212;no; we tried to scoop out the middle, but
even Bill declined and said he guessed he&#8217;d flop
her over and bake her again tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, this time mine seems to be all right,&#8221;
remarked Bess, as she peered into the oven.</p>

<p>What a chat the two were having, both enjoying
it greatly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came in here trying to find Mrs. West. I
am going away this afternoon and am anxious to
make a settlement with her before leaving.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This afternoon&#8212;you are going&#8212;away,&#8221;
asked the girl in a tone more solicitous than she
realized. Davis slowly rose from his chair and
hobbled near Bess, standing with her hands
clasped loosely behind her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8212;do you care? Tell me you care. Tell
me you&#8217;ll miss me, little girl,&#8221; he said, with a
sudden outburst of passion, as he clasped both
the girl&#8217;s hands in his own strong hold. He bent
his head low. The fragrance from her hair intoxicated
him and a great desire seized him to
clasp her in his arms.</p>

<p>Bess, frightened at his unexpected and new
attitude toward her, for a moment could not
move. She felt his breath against her hair, and
heard his heart as it beat loudly. She felt afraid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
to move lest she hurt his foot, and now the blood
was throbbing in her throat painfully. The
thought flashed through her mind that they were
alone in the big house, and even could she have
cried out for some one to come, she felt that it
would be an insult to the man near her. What
had she to fear?</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please! Mr. Davis, you hurt my hands.
Let me go, you must,&#8221; she said emphatically, as
she wrestled her hands free and turned directly
about. With a bewildered exclamation she put
her hand to her cheek, and stared with wrinkled
brow at the man who was standing so near her.
For the first time in her young life she read in
a man&#8217;s face the unspoken words of passion and
love. In the moment she stood motionless the
veil was lifted from her virgin soul, and the miracle
of womanhood was wrought! Into that
brief space crowded undreamed dreams; new and
strange insights, wonderful knowledge! She
felt herself grow old, as all these strange sensations
crowded themselves into her unsophisticated
mind. A look of mingled dismay, unintelligibility
and terror crept into the girl&#8217;s face, as
she was held spell-bound by the magnetic voice
of the man, and by deep glowing eyes that held
her fascinated against her will.</p>

<p>He drew nearer and nearer and breathed a
torrent of passionate love into her ears. His face
nearly touched hers, and she was wholly unable
to move. The man knew that he was the first one
to teach her of passion and he felt an exultant
pride of possession, already.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be frightened, little one,&#8221; he said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
her in the softest, most endearing tone he could
master. &#8220;Cannot you understand how wonderful
it is to love and to be loved? Let me teach
you all it means, dear. Let me tell you that you
are essential now to my happiness and to my
very existence. You all unconsciously have made
me love you&#8212;love you, till I cannot breathe without
you. Tell me, that you do love me. Tell me&#8212;tell
me,&#8221; and his voice sank to an almost inaudible,
yet imperative whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8212;oh! Please, Mr. Davis&#8212;I&#8212;do&#8212;not
even know you. Oh&#8212;do&#8212;not&#8212;please do not
talk so to me!&#8221; her husky voice trembled, so
choked with emotion that he could scarcely understand
what she said.</p>

<p>He knew it would be sheer temerity to press
his suit further for the present, so he stroked her
hair with a soft caress, and said: &#8220;Never mind
now, dear; think of all I have said, and when I
come again you will understand. Good-bye now,
for I shall not see you again before leaving,&#8221; and
giving her hair another gentle touch, he adjusted
his crutch and left the room.</p>

<p>Bess&#8217; hands fell at her sides. Amazed, her
eyes followed the man as he passed through the
doorway. All her senses seemed to have been
dulled by the recent avowal still ringing in her
ears. She was lost to her surroundings, and
stood still and silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s burning, Bess?&#8221; called Henry West,
as he stopped at the outside door of the kitchen,
while passing. Bess was brought to earth with
such a thud that she clutched at her heart to
stop its pounding. Quickly she sprang to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
oven and succeeded in partially concealing her
confusion by peering into it just as West stepped
into the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather hot work, cooking, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he ventured,
unsuspectingly, as the girl lifted her scarlet
face to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me&#8212;it is nearly burned! I forgot&#8212;everything!&#8221;
she said disconnectedly as she
snatched the cake from the stove and placed it
on the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! it&#8217;s hot!&#8221; she exclaimed, as she stuck her
finger into her mouth; then looking at it she saw
a large, white blister swelling upon the tender
skin.</p>

<p>West saw at once that she had burned her
hand and hastily applied some soda to relieve the
pain. With tender care he wrapped it up, and
when the smarting had ceased, told Bess he
would help her to get the meal.</p>

<p>She was still ill at ease, and the incident of a
few moments ago kept asserting itself in little
spasms that would make her catch her breath.
In her ears kept ringing the echo of Davis&#8217; burning
words, and she longed to flee to her room, to
be alone, to think&#8212;to think&#8212;to cry. She surely
would cry&#8212;she felt tears coming.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Henry&#8212;I can&#8217;t stay&#8212;I want to go to&#8212;my&#8212;,&#8221;
but by this time the floodgates of pent-up
feelings had opened wide, and with tears
streaming down her cheeks she fled to the silence
and comfort of her own dear room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor little girl; she is nervous trying to do
so much this morning,&#8221; soliloquized Henry, drawing
off his coat and tying on a large apron. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
then began to make preparations for the noon-day
meal.</p>

<p>Just then, up the road leading to the house,
drove one of the Indian police with a comfortable
conveyance. By the time he could reach the
porch, Davis, who had been watching the arrival,
was already there dressed to go away.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I be of any service,&#8221; asked Henry
West, with civility.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you. The man will fetch down my
things.&#8221;</p>

<p>West walked out to hold the horses while the
minor preparations were going on, and helped
Davis to a comfortable position in the rig.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry not to have seen your mother before
leaving. Please tell her I shall be over here
again, as soon as possible, to&#8212;to&#8212;remunerate
her for all the inconvenience to which I have
placed her,&#8221; said Davis; and then, without further
addressing West, ordered the man to start.</p>

<p>West stood for several moments watching
the departure; the only emotion which he betrayed
being a convulsive closing of his hands
and eyes.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<span class="medium">AN INDIAN IN THE MOONLIGHT</span></h2>


<p>When Mrs. West returned to the ranch in
the evening, she sought Bess in her room to
learn of her experience in the culinary department
during the day. As she tapped at the door
and softly entered, a dejected, dishevelled and
tear-stained figure arose and flung her arms
about the &#8220;little Mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>Impulsively and swiftly she poured into Mrs.
West&#8217;s astonished ears all that had transpired
that morning, and when she had finished, she
said, &#8220;Why, little Mother, I love so much already,
I cannot find room for any more. I love
you&#8212;I love James&#8212;the birds&#8212;the grass and
flowers! I love the mountains and the wonderful
lake! I love my music&#8212;my books and my
pictures! I love Mauchacho&#8212;I love babies&#8212;and
dogs. Where is there room for any more?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Mrs. West led her to a seat, and taking
both the girl&#8217;s hands into her own, told her that
the love of all these things was so entirely different
from the love she would one day understand,
that they would be crowded out and set
apart when her heart was ready to receive the
great and inevitable passion.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I do think, dear, that Major Davis was
rather premature in his announcement. Perhaps
selfishness prompted him, and he spoke before
leaving you lest someone else would try to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
teach my little girl life&#8217;s most wonderful and
most beautiful lesson. He need not have been
so anxious, however, as there are no eligible
young men near here, except perhaps my own
son.&#8221; After a slight pause she added, &#8220;But he
is&#8212;he is&#8212;only an Indian!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, little Mother! What difference need
that make! He has the whitest heart! That is
his greatest innate quality, the one which
prompts him to be a&#8212;<em>man</em>! God does not make
any discrimination between him and me; why
should insignificant <em>I</em> presume to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Impulsively Bess threw her arms about Mrs.
West&#8217;s neck, and looked deeply into her eyes.
For a moment, neither could say a word, and
when Mrs. West assumed control of her voice
she said: &#8220;My dear child&#8212;thank you for your
sympathy; it helps so much. But, there is all
the world&#8212;outside there, who do not understand
as you do, dear; who do not feel as you
feel; who&#8212;,&#8221; but she could say no more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, little Mother, let us go out by the
lake and watch the moon rise. We each need
God and nature tonight.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they passed through the hall-way Bess
gently placed a light shawl about Mrs. West&#8217;s
shoulders, and taking a wrap for herself, together
they went out into the night.</p>

<p>As she passed the door of the living-room she
saw Henry reclining on a cozy couch and knew,
from the listless manner in which he held a
book, that he had fallen asleep. Over his knees
was spread a bright-colored Navajo blanket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>Together they walked, their hands clasped in
loving pressure. Bess knew where a log, sheltered
from any passing breeze, commanded a
splendid view of both the lake and the mountains.
It was quite a little walk from the house,
and gladly Mrs. West seated herself to recover
her breath.</p>

<p>The scene was too beautiful to be marred by
idle words, and each felt that to speak would be
sacrilegious. All about them was the purple
twilight, deep and silent,&#8212;immeasurable silence
everywhere, except where the tiny waves
splashed against a rock, or a tall pine whispered
a tender sigh to a near-by tamarack. Myriads of
quivering stars hung balanced in the far-off sky,
and occasionally one shot out across the illimitable
space, with a tiny trail of light, which suddenly
became extinguished as if it had sunk into
the sea. By this symbol, the shooting star, the
world might know a soul had been released and
found its way to heaven. Mrs. West reverently
crossed herself, and Bess gave the hand a pressure
of understanding.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bess, dear, I fear I am growing chilly. It
will be some time before the moon shows over the
hills. We better go indoors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, little Mother, let me remain a little
while. I shall not be afraid. Why! I have been
here several times alone before! All I have
thought of is the stars! There are so many
things I must think of before I could go to sleep.
That&#8217;s a dear&#8212;let me stay,&#8221; she concluded in
such an entreaty that Mrs. West allowed herself
to be gently turned toward the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>Bess stood watching till the retreating figure
became fainter and fainter and was swallowed in
the gloom of the willows near the spring.</p>

<p>She was alone&#8212;alone with the stars, the sea&#8212;the
moon. Alone with all the new and strange
emotions which she had learned this day!
&#8220;Hurry, oh, moon! Come over the tops, to help
me to think! To give me light! To teach me to
know and to understand!&#8221; she prayed.</p>

<p>The sky grew brighter, the rough and rugged
tips of the mountains softened and glowed with
luminous silvery light, and the tiny ripples on
the lake caught the half-shed radiance, glistening
like millions of jewels. The girl drew her
wrap snugly about her and sinking into a seat
on a rock with her back against the huge log,
drew her knees up so that her chin rested against
them on her clasped hands. Her ears rang with
the words they had heard in the morning&#8212;&#8220;I
love you&#8212;you made me love you!&#8221; till she knew
no other thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but how can anyone know&#8212;know,
when they really love! How is one to be sure&#8212;sure&#8212;sure!&#8221;
The girl&#8217;s thoughts thronged.
&#8220;All love seems to me the same! The degree may
vary, but it all feels the same! How am I to
know when I possess that other kind! Dear me,
what&#8217;s the use of trying to love any more when
my heart is too crowded already! No&#8212;I guess
I won&#8217;t try&#8212;won&#8217;t even try to love you, Mr.
Davis.&#8221; She straightened with a relieved sigh.</p>

<p>Just then, the moon, fair, round and full,
shot up over the crests, and all the world was
filled with beautiful, silvery light. One could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
distinguish the greens of the pines and firs as
well as the browns and greys of the rocks. Even
the girl&#8217;s dress showed a softest pink in the tender
moonlight. How glorious it was! The lake
looked like the sea as it stretched across the
miles to the far shore. The mountains towered
loftily into the vault of heaven. The quietude of
the forests, as the gigantic monarchs bathed in
the glowing light. And above all, to <em>be</em>, to
<em>breathe</em>, to <em>live</em> amongst all this sublimity of
beauty. How glorious it all is! What more
could one wish? What more could one love?
What need of any other kind of love? On&#8212;on
ran the thoughts of the girl, all unconscious
physically, save to the wonder of the night.</p>

<p>A movement behind her, caused her to turn
her head quickly. She smothered a cry of fear
as she saw approaching through the trees, a tall
form closely wrapped in a brightly-colored blanket.
How clearly she could distinguish the colors
as the man came from the shadows out into
the brilliant moonlight. Bess held her breath
and did not move as the man stopped and looked
searchingly about. Silently he stood; then suddenly
flinging out his arms and lifting his face
to the witchery of the moon, the blanket fell off
his shoulders to the ground about him and revealed
Henry West.</p>

<p>What a picture he made! His upturned face,
silhouetted against the trees, seemed in a halo of
light&#8212;the arms lifted in an appeal to the sky.
The garb of the white man enshrouded him, the
robe of the Indian lay at his feet. Slowly he
passed his hands across his brow with a despairing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
gesture, and held them over his eyes, as if
they could no longer endure the lovely, if loveless,
night.</p>

<p>When the object of her alarm had vanished,
Bess startled West by springing quickly to the
top of the log and saying: &#8220;Oh, Henry! How
you frightened me! When I saw you stalking
through the trees I thought it was an In&#8212;!&#8221;
Quickly as she checked herself, she was not quick
enough, for West ended her sentence for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indian! So I was&#8212;see, lying here at my
feet!&#8221;</p>

<p>He stooped and picked up the Navajo blanket
which he had hastily caught off the couch and
wrapped about him when his mother awakened
him.</p>

<p>He quietly walked over to the girl standing
on the log, nonchalantly enfolded himself in the
blanket, crossed it over his face to his eyes, and
for a moment stood motionless. Bess placed her
fingers against her parted lips as if to keep back
any idle words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes&#8212;sometimes&#8212;now, I wish all I
knew was how to wrap my blanket about me!&#8221;
he said, with effort. &#8220;The great outside world
does not want me, cannot understand me. What
need or comfort are the things which the world
has taught me, when after all, my winding-sheet
will be but a blanket? What right has the world
to give me a desire for knowledge, a taste of
heaven, an understanding of the past, a dread of
the future, and then hold up its hands to say,
&#8216;You are still an Indian.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Again he let the blanket drop at his feet and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
stood gazing into the moon, while written on his
face were despair and longing and resignation.
A chord in the girl&#8217;s heart was touched at the
sight of the strong man before her, and it was set
attune to the one which had been awakened in
the churchyard, where she once before saw his
misery. She sprang lightly to the ground, picked
up the blanket and placed it again about his
shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like to see you so. You are too often sad,
Henry. Tell me something I may do to make
you happy. Tell me!&#8221; Bess entreated.</p>

<p>West stood looking at her for a moment, the
shadow of a fleeing cloud hiding the love-light
which shone in his dark eyes, then said: &#8220;You
placed my blanket about me, that&#8217;s enough.
Mother is anxious about you, Bess, and sent me
to bring you into the house. Come&#8212;one may
have too much moon you know.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<span class="medium">A FRANTIC HERD</span></h2>


<p>The next morning at breakfast, Henry West
told his mother that he was going to meet James
Fletcher and six of his cowboys, over at the ferry,
as they came with a bunch of steers from the
range about the Big Arm. Then they would
drive them South to Selish, where they were to
be loaded and shipped to a large stock ranch in
Wyoming, to a man whose winter loss had been
great.</p>

<p>Bess became at once deeply interested in the
affair, and asked if she might go over to the ferry
with him to witness the feat of swimming the
bunch across the Pend d&#8217;Oreille.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to have half a dozen Indians
take cattle across the river, and the boys will
cross on the ferry with their horses so that they
will be in shape to continue with the drive.
Otherwise they would all be delayed by getting
into dry clothing,&#8221; explained West. &#8220;Yes, you
and Mother both come. It will be quite a novel
sight, for you, at least, Bess.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl was delighted and hastened to help
straighten up the house, so that Mrs. West might
go also. She stopped a moment in her task, as
she watched West get into his riding togs. The
heavily fringed leathern chapps, the belt, with
its cartridges and gun, the spurs and quirt were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
all quickly and deftly adjusted by the experienced
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me tie that for you,&#8221; suggested Bess, as
Henry fumbled with his white silk &#8217;kerchief, trying
to fasten it about his throat without removing
his gloves which he had already drawn on his
hands. She tucked the dish-towel which she had
been using under her arm, and standing on her
tip-toes, tied the handkerchief about his neck.</p>

<p>As her soft, dainty fingers touched his throat
he closed his eyes to shut out the sight of the
sweet girl so near him lest they reveal the exquisite
pain which thrilled his whole being. He
gripped his hands together behind him, fearing,
in spite of himself, they would snatch her to him
and crush her in an embrace. Through his closed
teeth he said, &#8220;Hurry, Bess,&#8221; for fear he should
yet lose control of himself; and once the floodgates
of his passion be opened, there would be no
pause till he had poured out all the longings and
hopes and desires of his very soul. He knew the
girl was entirely ignorant and unsuspicious of
his love for her, and he did not dare frighten her
by a confession, for fear the consequences might
deprive him of even the comfort of being near
her and seeing and hearing her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Bess, as she gave him a saucy tap
on the cheek, &#8220;can&#8217;t you stand still a moment!
Now see, you have undone it. Really, you are
more impatient to start than Mauchacho usually
is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give it a half-hitch, Bess, and call it fixed,&#8221;
said West, as he backed away from the girl to
free himself from her delicious touch. Snatching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
his sombrero and starting for the door, he
continued: &#8220;You and Mother be at the ferry
within an hour. One of the men will saddle your
horses for you. Good-bye.&#8221; Then hastily returning,
as if he had forgotten an important
item he called: &#8220;Oh say, Bess! How about your
gun practice? Are you improving any?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know, Henry, that the last time I
tried, I only had to hold one eye shut, and once I
nearly hit the mark!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nearly&#8212;how nearly?&#8221; laughed West. &#8220;Remember,
when you can shoot with both eyes open
and hit the bull&#8217;s-eye three times in succession,
then&#8212;then you are to have the 38 Smith and
Wesson, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that he was gone to the gate, touched
his foot in the stirrup, sprang with the agility
of a cat into the saddle and started off quickly.
Just then, however, Bess noticed that he had
dropped his handkerchief, and saw the rider
swing his horse quickly about, drop low over the
side of the saddle, snatch the handkerchief from
the ground, resume his position in the saddle and
gallop on as though it were no feat at all. She
cried out in her astonishment, so that Mrs. West
came hurriedly in to learn the cause of her
alarm. When Bess told her what she had just
witnessed, Mrs. West smiled, and explained that
at the July celebration she would have an opportunity
to see some really wonderful feats in riding.</p>

<p>&#8220;Henry told me just now that I must hurry
to win the new gun he promised me,&#8221; said Bess,
as she and Mrs. West hurried about, finishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the breakfast work. &#8220;Do you know,&#8221; continued
the girl, &#8220;it seems to me I would be very conspicuous
with a gun stuck into my belt. James
and Henry both agree that if I insist upon going
about alone with my horse, that I must have a
gun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dear, one cannot tell what unexpected
danger might arise. A drunken Indian, or an infuriated
steer, or even a rattlesnake may molest
one, and the boys are wise in insisting,&#8221; answered
Mrs. West.</p>

<p>At first, when Henry West brought out the
22 rifle to give Bess her first lesson, she ran behind
a tree and thrust her fingers in her ears.
After a little she would pull the trigger with
both eyes shut tight, if he would hold the gun.
At length she submitted to having it placed
against her shoulder and to holding it unassisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Bess! Don&#8217;t be such a baby,&#8221; said her
brother to her one day, as she was trying to overcome
her aversion to shooting the 22. Instantly
her eyes <em>looked daggers</em> at the boys; snatching
the gun, she thrust it up against her shoulder,
pulled the trigger and banged away! When she
opened her eyes she saw James peering from behind
one tree and Henry from another. Both
were smiling at her impetuosity, but James then
and there told her that the first essential was to
handle a weapon carefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is all right!! But don&#8217;t you call me a
baby again! I&#8217;ll beat you shooting yet! See if
I don&#8217;t!&#8221; flung back the girl.</p>

<p>During the next week, while the boys were at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Selish with the shipment of steers, Bess practiced
with the little rifle at every opportunity,
and her progress was marked indeed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mauchacho is feeling gay this morning,
Bess,&#8221; said Mrs. West, as she and the girl mounted
and started for the ferry at Polson. The
dainty horse shook his head and side-stepped
first one way and then the other. He seemed to
know and feel that he carried a graceful rider,
and was doing these little extra steps to add to
the charming picture.</p>

<p>Bess&#8217; lithe body swung to each new antic, and
the ruddy glow of health on her cheeks told how
keen was the enjoyment.</p>

<p>&#8220;My! how dearly I love to feel a horse under
me!&#8221; she cried as she leaned forward to smooth
a strand in the horse&#8217;s mane. &#8220;It seems to me
that I shall hate ever having to go on wheels
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. West rode like one thoroughly accustomed
to the saddle, erect and well poised, with
her right arm clinging down by her side, and the
reins held firmly up in the left. She, too, rode
astride, and her eyes were bright with as keen
an enjoyment as the happy girl&#8217;s by her side.</p>

<p>&#8220;It does put new life into one, dear, to be on
a horse,&#8221; responded the older woman. &#8220;I have
not had a ride for ever so long, and this is surely
a delight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just as they reached Polson they could see
on the opposite shore of the river several cowboys
and half a dozen Indians driving some fifty
or sixty head of cattle. The water in the lake
was still very high,&#8212;in fact it had risen two feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
since the day before, and now came pouring into
the river, its outlet, with terrific speed. The roar
of the falls about a half-mile below the ferry was
distinctly heard, and told of the immense volume
of water which was pouring and bounding over
the huge rocks and precipice.</p>

<p>Henry West was watching with a troubled
face the foaming stream and the reluctant herd
on the opposite side. Bess saw her brother signal
the cowboys to cross on the waiting ferry,
and then instruct the Indians at which point to
swim the cattle and their ponies across. The
water was icy cold, and with greatest effort and
urging were the steers forced into the stream.
Such shouts, and yelling, and riding and driving!
Finally the last steer was driven into the
water as some of the others were already nearly
half-way across. The Indians had flung off their
blankets, and with wild and weird shouts,
plunged their horses into the water. The snorts
of the reluctant animals mingled with the song
that went up from the bucks. How the cattle
fought against the current which bore them down
stream! How the ponies worked, with their burdens
now swimming alongside and clinging to
their manes! How the Indians shouted now to
the horses, now to the cattle, and again to each
other! A laugh, almost hideous in its bravado,
rent the air, and again the song of courage could
be heard above all the confusion.</p>

<p>Bess was wild with excitement. She was relieved
to see James on the ferry crossing with the
cowboys and their horses. She looked for Henry
West and discovered him far down on the bank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
at about the place where the herd would come
out. He paced up and down with anxiety, and
the girl could feel his care. The first of the cattle
had already gained the land, and another&#8212;another.
Look! there was one which seemed to
be losing wind and was being borne downward
by the current. Instantly the animal was seen
by an Indian, who, in his effort to head off the
course, loosened his grip on his pony&#8217;s mane and
snatched frantically for the floating tail. He
grasped it, but not firmly enough, and soon was
swimming alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come straight ahead,&#8221; called West to the
now dazed Indian. The rest, with their ponies
and the steers, were clambering up the steep incline
of the bank and were entirely oblivious to
the danger of their companion, their bodies, all
dripping, gleaming like burnished copper in the
dazzling sunshine. Springing upon their ponies
they rode hurriedly to the approaching ferry, to
wrap their naked bodies in the blankets which
Fletcher was bringing across. Only West was
conscious of the peril of the one Indian, except
those on the ferry who had seen the struggle,
and Bess, who had ridden Mauchacho down to
where West was standing. He kept urging and
exhorting the swimmer, who was constantly
gaining and nearing the shore. Bess noticed that
West had removed his chapps and coat, as if preparing
to go to the assistance of the man in the
water.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it were not so icy cold he&#8217;d make it all
right,&#8221; said West, unaware of the girl dismounting
near him. In the next instant he had jerked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
off his boots, flung his sombrero at Bess&#8217; feet and
plunged into the foaming water some thirty feet
further down the stream than where the Indian
was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t,&#8221; shrieked Bess, but all too late, for
he was already swimming with long measured
strokes toward the now exhausted man. Oh!
would he reach the spot in time? Could he force
his strength against the current and save the Indian
from being carried onto the Falls and
dashed to pieces on the rocks? Bess held her
breath as she watched.</p>

<p>Like a flash she saw his arm shoot out and
firmly catch the Indian by one of his long braids!
Now he was turning, now swimming back with
his burden! By this time the excited men
reached the spot and watched the rescue.</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet&#8212;West&#8217;ll fetch him!&#8221; &#8220;Sure&#8212;he&#8217;s
great in the water!&#8221; &#8220;Here they are now!&#8221;
&#8220;Keep&#8217;er up, old boy, you&#8217;re coming!&#8221; Bess
heard on all sides. James stood near, white-faced
and trembling, lest at the last moment West&#8217;s almost
Herculean strength might desert him.
Now he would surely make it! Together James
and Bess stretched forth their hands as if to help
West through the last few feet of water. When
his feet touched the earth and he struggled with
his now unconscious burden, he gasped,</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all right. See to the other man!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bess looked at Henry&#8217;s drawn and anxious
face, and tears rushed into her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, little girl, it&#8217;s over now,&#8221; he
said softly, touched by her solicitude; and instantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
flung all his savagery at the cowboy who
ventured:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a damn fool, West, to risk your life
for just an old Indian!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8212;he is my brother!&#8221; retorted West, with
eyes that might have killed with their intense
fire.</p>

<p>Bess hastened away to seek Mrs. West, and
was relieved to find that she had not known of
the danger her son had been in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get the bunch started, James,&#8221; said West,
&#8220;and I&#8217;ll join you where we take up the rest of
the herd.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was evening on the following day, when
the weary herd, urged by the still wearier men
and horses, came to the foot of the hill near the
shipping place. The dust raised by the hoofs of
two hundred steers was suffocating, and the cowboys
congratulated themselves that plenty of
water and &#8220;grub&#8221; were in sight.</p>

<p>The drive had been without incident or accident,
and West was silently commending the
good judgment of his foreman. By constant
shouting, urging and driving the steers gained
the summit of the hill and began to descend.
West saw a long freight train standing on the
tracks ready to start, and he became filled with
trepidation for fear the wild creatures would become
frightened, and serious consequences might
follow.</p>

<p>They reached the flat near the corrals. West
breathed a sigh of relief when suddenly the engine
gave two long, shrill whistles! The hills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
caught the sound and hurled it back and forth
again and again, as if the very fiends of the mountains
were exultant at the terror of the dumb
beasts! With a snort every head and tail went
up; all seemed possessed with the instinct of
flight from some dreadful danger. Wheeling,
they plunged up the steep hillside. Every man
knew instantly what to do. Three sent their
spurs into the tired horses and urged them up
the hill to head off the bellowing, frenzied herd.
The horses intuitively knew that there was
trouble, and were filled with new vim. With red
nostrils and wet flanks, out of breath they gained
the position and successfully turned the terrified
animals again down the hill. On they rushed,
snorting, bellowing, plunging, completely enveloped
in a cloud of dust. West and Fletcher
rode on to head them off, and now saw, as the
dust subsided a little, that the wild things had
begun already to go &#8216;round and round.&#8217; If they
should now get to milling, doubtless many of
them would be crushed to death!</p>

<p>Fletcher, seeing an opening, made a desperate
attempt to take it, but his wise pony wheeled,
but not quickly enough to evade the scratch of a
sharp horn. West, with a merciless dig of the
spur that caused the blood to spurt from the
horse&#8217;s side, made it leap clear off the ground
and come down on four stiffened legs in the only
open space among the steers. Practiced rider
tho&#8217; he was, he bounded high in the air, losing
his hat and nearly losing the saddle. With
swinging lariats, with hoarse shouts, with shots
and yells, at last the circling herd were checked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
and slowly began to fall into line and through
the openings into the corrals. When the last
steer was safely behind the strong enclosure of
the stockyards, West turned to his foreman with
a face that showed desperate determination
through the grime of dust and perspiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;You better go with the boys and get ready
for supper. I have a little matter of business to
attend to first.&#8221; Turning to the others, lifting
his bare head high, and with a look of approval
in his flashing eyes, he said, &#8220;Boys, you have
proven yourselves equal to any occasion! I&#8217;m
proud of each one of you!&#8221;</p>

<p>He waited till the cheers and waving hats of
the cowboys had subsided, waited till he saw
them lead the horses, with now drooping heads,
to shelter and food, waited for James to follow
the others, and then rode his horse over to the
station platform. Riding up on the platform he
rapped on the window with the loaded end of his
quirt, and motioned to the man inside to come
out. In a low, tense voice he asked: &#8220;Where&#8217;s
the shipping agent?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m your man,&#8221; came from a large bunch of
corduroys.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the shipper of that bunch of cattle in
the yards. Perhaps you saw our averted catastrophe.
Instruct your engineers hereafter to
avoid whistles when wild steers are being
driven.&#8221;</p>

<p>The corduroy man replied: &#8220;That engineer&#8217;s
resignation has already been telegraphed to
headquarters. A man with no better sense than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
he displayed is incapable of holding a job on this
division.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a few more remarks incidental to the
loading and shipping next morning, West turned
his horse in quest of his sombrero. As he wheeled
he came face to face with Fletcher, whose curiosity
prompted him to follow West. For a moment
neither spoke, and then James blurted out,
&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be d&#8212;d, West; you always know just
what to do and what&#8217;s more, do it!&#8221;</p>

<p>As they neared the spot where their serious
trouble with the cattle occurred, a faint sound of
distress reached West&#8217;s acute ear. Searching behind
a huge pile of rock and brush, he discovered
one of the best steers with its front legs broken.
In the flash of an instant he had pulled his gun
and the true and sure aim ended the dumb
brute&#8217;s misery. All he remarked was, &#8220;Another
feast for some hungry &#8216;Injun,&#8217;&#8221; and hurried to
join the other men at supper.</p>

<span class="medium">THE FIRST VISIT OF DAVE DAVIS</span></h2>


<p>&#8220;It seems ages since the boys left for the
round-up,&#8221; remarked Bess to Mrs. West, one afternoon,
as they sat sewing. &#8220;When do you think
they will be home?&#8221;</p>

<p>Folding the soft, white cloth, which seemed
to accentuate the dark-skinned hands, Mrs. West
paused a moment before answering.</p>

<p>&#8220;Um, well, let me see! They started about
ten days ago. They ought to be through on Sullivan
Creek by this time, and then to Dayton
Creek and home. Perhaps in four days more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, when they come, I think they will discover
two things. One, that I have wasted heaps
of ammunition, and two&#8212;that I can &#8216;hit the
spot&#8217; three times&#8212;almost,&#8221; laughingly replied
Bess, as she sat near the window, unconsciously
lifting some faded American Beauty roses from a
vase. As if suddenly commanding her thoughts,
she gave the flowers such a vigorous thrust back
into their receptacle that the water flew into her
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why girlie&#8212;what a way to treat your poor
roses!&#8221; said Mrs. West.</p>

<p>Half ashamed and half defiantly Bess turned.
&#8220;Why did not Mr. Davis send the roses to you?
You were the one who cared for him. He seems
to have forgotten that, and I&#8217;d like to remind
him of it, too,&#8221; she said, with a flash in her eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the opportunity is at hand; but please
don&#8217;t,&#8221; replied Mrs. West, for just then she saw
Mr. Davis ride into the yard.</p>

<p>So completely was Bess surprised at the unexpected
appearance of the subject of her
thoughts, that she strove in vain to cover her
embarrassment. Hot blood rushed to her cheeks.
Fragrant, waving, brown hair half shielded her
eyes, and for once she was glad of its unruly
fluffiness.</p>

<p>At first she thought only of flight, for somehow
she did not feel that she could as yet meet
the man whose last words to her still rung in her
ears, and caused little qualms of fear in her
heart. During the weeks in which she had not
seen him she tried in vain to banish him from her
mind; but the strange fascination which he held
over her only seemed to increase. And yet she
knew her heart did not leap for joy at thought of
him, but rather its quickened beatings caused
her an undesirable pain,&#8212;one so strange, and
new and foreign. Could it be that this was love,&#8212;that
great, mysterious thing which, whether
we will or no, grips our very souls like bands of
steel, and wrings them most piteously. How
could she know? She had dreamed that with
love came the sense of peace and rest; the feeling
of utter repose and satisfaction, the complete
knowledge of all that is good and true, the fulness
of contentment, the satisfaction of every
heart-felt longing; and here, at the very first appearance
of the man who had so ardently confessed
his devotion for her, her one thought was
to flee, to hide and not to see him. Instead, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
remained standing, perfectly quiet, and by the
time she heard his step in the hall and Mrs.
West&#8217;s cheery salutation she was quite mistress
of herself.</p>

<p>With still a hesitancy in his walk, he came
into the room. How his face brightened and his
step quickened at sight of Bess. Eagerly he
stepped forward and clasped her extended hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to see you have improved greatly
in so short a time,&#8221; ventured Bess, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks; but to me the past weeks have
seemed an eternity. Not a word, not a sign from
the little girl I left so reluctantly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bess felt like calling to Mrs. West as she
passed the doorway,&#8212;she could not be alone
with Mr. Davis.</p>

<p>&#8220;You came to see Mrs. West,&#8221; said Bess in a
tentative way; &#8220;I&#8217;ll call her!&#8221; But as she stepped
forward towards the door, her face lifted and
lips parted ready to call, the man abruptly intervened,
caught her to him and smothered the
sound upon her lips. Again and again he kissed
her till she had no breath to give voice to her
anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8212;you&#8212;stop&#8212;how dare you frighten
me so! You have no right to&#8212;to&#8212;&#8221; but tears
choked her voice and she could only gaze at him
with flashing eyes.</p>

<p>The man did not move nor offer any words.
Slowly he put his hands in his pockets and
looked at her with eyes that burned into her very
soul and held her spell-bound. How handsome he
looked,&#8212;so tall and large, health again glowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
in his face and form. For a full moment thus he
stood, immovable, immutable! Never for an instant
did he lift his eyes from the girl&#8217;s! Now
her eyelids gave a brief quiver, her lips parted in
a soft sigh, and her hands fell listlessly by her
side. Then he spoke, in a voice so low that it was
scarcely audible, so tender that its caress seemed
like music.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come here, dear!&#8221; Lifting one hand in an
appealing gesture, he held it poised for a moment
and then let it rest gently on a fluffy brown
head, which moved slowly and irresolutely near
to him. Lifting the girl&#8217;s face so that he could
look directly into the eyes, he said: &#8220;Tell me&#8212;have
I no right to love you, or to make you&#8212;<em>make</em>
you love in return? Nothing seems good to me
but you; you have my heart and soul to save or
destroy; you&#8212;little girl&#8212;are the keeper of my
happiness, my very existence. The miserable
days without you have been unbearable; the long
nights more miserable still. I love you&#8212;do you
understand that&#8212;<em>love you</em>&#8212;I want you&#8212;and
shall have you!&#8221; Again he grew fierce, and held
the girl so firmly that he felt her struggle for
breath. Slowly relaxing his arms and gently
placing the girl before him he continued: &#8220;Kiss
me now, Bess, of your own free will, and that
will tell me that you love me.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment she stood silent, dumb. A
spasmodic quiver shook her body and trembling
eyelids covered her eyes. Her hands went to her
heart as if trying to restore its beating, and suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
she stepped back, flung out her chin, and in
a voice almost uncontrollable with emotion said,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll call&#8212;Mrs.&#8212;West&#8212;&#8221; and ran out of the
room before her admirer could prevent.</p>

<p>He stood a moment at the vacant doorway
and then, with a sinister smile showing the firm,
white teeth set hard together, he said, half audibly:
&#8220;You&#8212;shall!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bess found Mrs. West and succeeded rather
poorly in trying to be calm. The dear, white-haired
woman placed her arm lovingly about the
girl and led her gently back into the living-room.</p>

<p>Mr. Davis was standing with his back to the
door as they entered, toying carelessly with the
faded roses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your beautiful roses were greatly enjoyed
and appreciated. We thank you for them, Mr.
Davis,&#8221; said Bess, in a voice which showed that
she had not yet recovered her composure.</p>

<p>She still clung to Mrs. West&#8217;s hand, as if she
needed her assuring clasp. Mrs. West could not
refrain a smile at the extra stress which the girl
placed on the &#8220;we,&#8221; and added: &#8220;Yes, and you
may judge by their condition, Mr. Davis, how
greatly they were prized. American Beauties are
not plentiful here, and their rarity as well as
their beauty makes them doubly dear.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry, Mrs. West, to have been so tardy
in coming to see you. But I found affairs in
great confusion when I returned to the Agency.
Will you kindly tell me how much I am indebted
to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>A look of anger and humiliation clouded the
woman&#8217;s face. She did not reply at once and was
relieved from doing so by Bess, who drew herself
up to her full height and said with a bravado that
astonished both her hearers: &#8220;Mr. Davis, do not
insult my little Mother by offering money for her
kindness towards you. Such indebtedness is
only liquidated by&#8212;by&#8212;gratitude, and by&#8212;roses,&#8221;
she added, glancing at Mrs. West, and
pulled the shriveled petals off and dropped them
carelessly on the rug.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see it is utterly useless to offer anything
but my thanks, Mrs. West.&#8221; Davis held out his
hand to her and turning to the girl he added,
&#8220;And may I send more roses?&#8221;</p>

<p>As he took his departure a moment later, Mrs.
West asked Bess if she would ride as far as Polson
with Mr. Davis and bring the mail. There
did not seem any plausible excuse to offer for not
wishing to go, and Davis gladly waited until she
had donned her riding habit and a man had
brought Mauchacho from the stables.</p>

<p>What a delight to the eye was the tall, lithe
form, with its becoming green skirt and soft,
fluffy waist. The sombrero was tied on securely
with her long, white, silky veil, that caressed the
pink cheeks. Long gauntlet gloves with fringed
ends dangling, and a dainty quirt, gave her an
added touch of individuality. She spurned the
proffered assistance to mount, and had gained
the saddle before it was fairly given. The little
dread which she had at first felt at riding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
three miles with Mr. Davis had left her, for somehow
the indescribable feeling she had, when he
first came, had completely vanished, and she
knew that she was again complete mistress of
herself&#8212;she was the generalissimo!</p>

<p>The horses&#8217; hoofs filled her ears with music as
the two rode along, almost without a word, and
by the time they reached Polson&#8217;s she was completely
at ease and all the passion and fear of the
past hour were, for the time, at least, forgotten.</p>

<p>Mr. White, seeing their approach, brought
the packet of letters out to Bess, who eagerly examined
them. At one, her face lighted up with
beautiful happiness, and she cried out: &#8220;Oh,
goody&#8212;one at last from Bee!&#8221;</p>

<p>After a few desultory remarks to Mr. White,
Davis turned his horse to go. Lifting his hat to
Miss Fletcher, now buried in the pages of a voluminous
letter, he spoke so low that he doubted
if she heard, she gave a nod and smile to his,
&#8220;Remember, the roses are only for you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bess crowded the pages of the letter into its
envelope, and thrusting all the mail into her
blouse she leaned forward with a quick command
to Mauchacho, who almost instantly caught the
girl&#8217;s eagerness and sped like the wind along the
border of the lake for home.</p>

<p>Davis turned in the saddle, resting his hand
on his horse&#8217;s back, to watch with admiration the
beautiful rider. The long, white veil was now
streaming far behind her like some dainty, fleecy
cloud, trying to keep pace with a fleeing nymph.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
There was no movement to her body, and she
seemed to be flying through space. Davis&#8217; hand
unconsciously restrained his horse, who was now
standing perfectly still. He watched the girl
ride out of sight behind a low hill, and when he
again resumed his journey he was filled with
greater determination than ever to win her at
any cost.</p>

<p>Mrs. West hurried to the door as she saw
Bess&#8217; unusual haste, but her anxiety was quickly
dispelled as she caught sight of the girl&#8217;s happy
face. Slipping off her horse&#8217;s back, Bess left him
with trailing reins, and sprang quickly up the
steps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, little Mother,&#8221; she cried, as she grasped
her hand and dragged her to a seat on the steps
beside her. Into her blouse she plunged her hand
and drew forth a letter which contained some
startling news, indeed.</p>

<p>&#8220;See! here is a letter from Bee&#8212;Berenice, you
know, and she writes&#8212;let me see, where is it?&#8221;
She wet her thumb and fumbled among the
pages. &#8220;Oh, here! &#8216;At last, dear Bess, I have
gained father&#8217;s consent to come to visit you,
although he knows I will surely be eaten by bears
or buffalos or captured by the Indians.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Bess laughed as she gave Mrs. West&#8217;s hand a
pressure of love and assurance. &#8220;She thinks, or
her father, rather, thinks we are still among savages,
doesn&#8217;t he?&#8221; Then she continued to read:
&#8220;&#8216;You see, dearie, I am quite worn out with the
care of sister&#8212;&#8217; Oh! haven&#8217;t I told you about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
it all, little Mother? Well, I will when I&#8217;ve finished
reading this; &#8216;with the care of sister, who
is much better now, better than she has been before
in all these miserable years, although we
have given up hope that she will ever be her dear
old self again.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Compassionate tears were swimming in Bess&#8217;
eyes so that with difficulty she continued reading,
&#8220;that the visit would not take place until
early in the autumn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really,&#8221; said Bess, &#8220;I can scarcely wait so
long. Berenice and I have been like sisters and
were always roommates in school, before her sister&#8217;s
health demanded her continual presence at
home. I have not even seen her since then.&#8221;</p>

<p>She now carefully replaced the letter in its
envelope and told Mrs. West briefly the tragedy
of the sister of her dearest friend, Berenice Morton.
It seems that about five years before this
time, Miss Grace Morton, who was attending
school in Massachusetts, met a Harvard man
with whom she fell deeply in love. He was also
enamored with the young woman and became a
frequent visitor. At last he persuaded Grace to
consent to a secret marriage, so that each might
continue in school and complete the year&#8217;s work
before announcing what they had done.</p>

<p>At first he was more devoted as a husband
than as a lover, but when it became imperative
to announce their secret marriage before the
close of the school year, she sent him an urgent
request to come to her and take her home to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
parents. In vain she waited for him; days grew
into weeks, and still he did not come. Driven to
desperation at last, she went home to face her
parents, to face the world, to bear her agony
alone. The shock was so great that the frail
mother could not bear it, and her death resulted
a few weeks later. But the strong-hearted father
and tender young sister opened their arms to the
poor, frail, young woman, and with all their combined
efforts sought to lessen her burden. Each
day she watched for some word or sign from the
man who had so cruelly deserted her, but as each
day closed without the pain and longing being
satisfied, she gradually sank deeper and deeper
in despair. Her dear ones began to hope that
with the advent of her child she might regain
her health of mind, but when the little one came
no flickering breath stirred its lips. In vain she
opened her arms to receive her treasure, and
when they remained empty her heart broke and
her mind fled in search of the tiny wandering
soul. During all of these years the brokenhearted
father and sister watched in vain for
some sign of recovery. Now Berenice had written
that she was better! Could it be possible
that at length their prayers would be answered?</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, in all our letters to each other, I
never felt like asking Berenice more than she
cared to write voluntarily; I do know, however,
that she met the man once while visiting her sister
at school shortly after the marriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Bess had finished telling Mrs. West the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
history of the tragedy, the little mother&#8217;s heart
was so wrung with tears and pity that she could
not speak, and abruptly entered the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; said Mrs. West, after she had
again found her voice, &#8220;what on earth could have
prompted any man to do such a cowardly, dastardly
act! I believe if I were placed in a similar
position with Mr. Morton and should ever
discover the scoundrel, I would&#8212;kill him!&#8221; she
said, half to herself and half to the girl, who had
followed her into the living-room, and who was
now gazing with wide, astonished eyes at the
excited woman. For the first time since Bess
had come to the <em>HW</em> ranch had she seen the
latent savagery aroused. How grand and imposing
the woman looked, standing straight and
rigid, her black eyes emitting flashes of fire!
One hand was thrust into the white tresses,
while the other, half upraised and clenched,
seemed to grasp an imaginary weapon! She
truly looked as if she meant what she said, and
as if she could do what she meant. Presently
she walked over to an open window, as if she
needed the fresh air which gently swayed the
curtains. When she had grown quite calm again
she turned to Bess, awed at the woman&#8217;s magnificent
rage.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;My dear, I am glad you are here with me,
and quite safe from those vultures who swoop
down upon any woman as legitimate prey, simply
for the gratification of a momentary passion.
They do not hesitate to match their strength
against the weak, nor to use every wile, hidden
by suavity of manner and equivocal promises, to
accomplish their purpose. I do not say all are
like this, but the few are ever ready, waiting.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s brown eyes filled with a strange
light, as if they did not comprehend the subtle
significance of the words, or perhaps saw for the
first time the full significance of what, heretofore,
had seemed like a faint, quavering intuition.
Her personal experience with men had
been so very limited, and withal so pleasant, that
she had felt a sort of brotherly interest in those
whom she knew. But somehow, now, there was
creeping into her soul an indescribable timidity
or fear, and for what she could scarcely define.
Into her mind flashed remnants of incidents she
had heard of brokenhearted girls, and the tragedy
of her friend&#8217;s sister stood out clear and
ominous! With a start she recalled the day
when she and Henry West stood near his sister
Helen&#8217;s grave, and the half incoherent words
again came into her mind and assumed a new
and terrible meaning. Yet, here stood the unsuspecting
mother, now grown sweet and calm
once more; surely, Bess&#8217; surmises must be wrong,
for how could any mother have such a secret
knowledge and still be able to smile&#8212;or even to
live?</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Bess thought, &#8220;I must not even think
such a thing of that dear, sweet, sleeping
stranger.&#8221;</p>

<p>At length Mrs. West came over to Bess, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
folding her in her arms stroked the soft tresses
as if she were her own daughter, still tiny, still
sweet, still living!</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear that I have alarmed you, dear, but
somehow those things always make me lose control
of myself, and I feel like the wild creatures
who are ever guarding their young against the
onslaughts of danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bess permitted herself to be held in the protecting
embrace for several moments, then suddenly
releasing herself, she sprang to the center
of the room, and dramatically drawing herself
up to her full height, throwing back her head
and clenching her hands, she said, with emotion
quavering in her voice: &#8220;Look&#8212;tell me&#8212;shall
I always be able to protect myself? Look!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. West was held entranced for a moment
by the beautiful girl. Health glowed in her eye
and reddened her lips and cheeks; strength of
character was stamped in every feature; the
strong will-power showed in the rigid jaw and
tense nostrils.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8212;I know you will always have the courage,
and God will give you strength.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<span class="medium">A JOURNEY UP FLATHEAD LAKE</span></h2>


<p>The round-up took longer this spring than
usual. There were more calves to be branded,
and several days of unpropitious weather delayed
the men. It was nearly three weeks since
Henry West and his cowboys and the foreman
had started to join the others on the range.
Eagerly had Bess and Mrs. West watched for
their return. News came, when the boys were
over on Sullivan Creek, that everything was progressing
nicely and that they would soon be
through, unless had weather prevented.</p>

<p>For the first time since Bess came to the
ranch she felt lonely. She did not care to read,
and her music seemed tame and uninteresting.
She sewed until Mrs. West compelled her to stop,
for she could see that the girl was growing nervous
over it. A dozen times a day she would
walk to the gate and scan the road toward Polson,
hoping that James might be coming. One
day, noticing that Bess seemed to be unusually
quiet, Mrs. West suggested that they go to Kalispell
to visit some friends and do some shopping.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is a beautiful trip up the lake and Flathead
River, and I am sure, dear, that you would
enjoy it. We can go better while the men are
away than later, and besides, I want to ask some
friends here for the July celebration, which the
Indians will have next month.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that would be fine!&#8221; said Bess, as she
brightened up. &#8220;I am so anxious to see what
kind of a Montana city Kalispell is. Could we
go on the boat this noon, do you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will hurry and try. It will not take me
long to arrange matters. You put a few things
into a suit case, while I give the Indian woman
some instructions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shortly Bess was ready and hurried into the
library to leave a note for James and Henry,
should they return while she and Mrs. West were
away.</p>

<p>They reached the boat in ample time, and
were pleasantly engaged in conversation with
several other passengers who were also going to
Kalispell when Bess heard her name spoken.
She did not turn her head and gave no outward
sign, save a vivid wave of color. Again she
heard the word &#8220;Bess,&#8221; as if it came to her from
a breeze off the lake, and she unconsciously summoned
all her strength to resist turning about.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Bess!&#8221; said Mrs. White, who had
walked down to the pier and onto the boat with
them, &#8220;some one must be speaking of you, for
see how your ears are burning,&#8221; and she jokingly
gave one of them a tiny pull. Just then Mrs.
West caught sight of a tall, handsome man who
still had a slight limp in his walk, as he stepped
upon the gang plank.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, ladies! It looks as if wishing
you &#8216;bon voyage&#8217; were opportune.&#8221; Bess
turned and acknowledged the greeting of Mr.
Davis. His eyes sought hers with that strange
fascination which possessed them the last time
she had seen him, and held her gaze. She suddenly
grew dumb and cold, and with a visible
effort controlled herself. &#8220;Are you not well this
morning, Miss Fletcher?&#8221; he asked, in a solicitous
voice, as he stepped directly before her, holding
out his hand.</p>

<p>The breeze had blown his soft, brown hair
about his face as he stood with his hat in his
hand, and Bess, at last finding her tongue, answered:
&#8220;I may not look well, Mr. Davis, but I
certainly combed my hair, which is more than
you have done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If mine is as becoming, blown into my eyes,
as yours is this very moment, then I shall never
comb it again.&#8221;</p>

<p>He knew the girl was trying to cover her embarrassment,
and he greatly relieved her when
he turned to address his remarks to Mrs. West,
from whom he learned that they were going to
Kalispell for a few days.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I also am going. I&#8217;m certainly most
fortunate to have such pleasant company,&#8221; Davis
said.</p>

<p>When Bess heard this she longed to go back
to the ranch, or go with Mrs. White. She could
not analyze the strange feeling which came over
her when near this man. While he fascinated her,
still he repulsed her; while she did not fear him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
still she felt ill at ease; while he interested her,
still she fought against it.</p>

<p>Everyone was aboard; the whistle shrieked
its departing signal, and the plank was being
pulled onto the boat when Bess hurriedly whispered
to Mrs. West, who was alarmed and astonished
at her really pale countenance, &#8220;Please&#8212;dearie&#8212;is
it too late? May I go home to the
ranch? I&#8212;really feel that I do not care to go&#8212;now&#8212;&#8221;
Suspicious moisture gathered under the
half-closed lids.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are ill, dear, certainly we shall go
home. Mr. Davis, I fear Bess is not well. Will
you ask them to hold the boat while we go
ashore?&#8221;</p>

<p>He sought the girl&#8217;s pale face anxiously, and
said: &#8220;Certainly, Mrs. West, and if I may I will
assist you in taking her to the ranch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8212;no,&#8221; cried the girl hurriedly. &#8220;You&#8212;I
am quite well and will go on,&#8221; and she ran quickly
up the stairway into the tiny cabin and flung
herself upon a couch.</p>

<p>Mrs. West and Mr. Davis looked at each other
for a moment, and then he said to her very
seriously, &#8220;Mrs. West, you understand as well as
I do, that the little girl is fighting&#8212;fighting
against the dictates of her own heart. She will
reciprocate sooner or later and love me as I do
her. May I go to her and speak to her now?&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do not be so impatient, Mr. Davis. Remember
she is still an unknowing child, one who is
afraid of strangers. One may cherish a rose-bud,
but let him attempt to open the petals before
they are formed and grown into rose-leaves,
he will discover only bruised and broken fragrance
in his hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your philosophy is true; but it is hard to
curb one&#8217;s impatience. I need her, Mrs. West,
and since these days of pain which I spent in
your home, the torture of being away from her is
hard to bear.&#8221;</p>

<p>She could not doubt the sincerity of his confession,
as she listened to his low, impassioned
words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you help me, Mrs. West? Tell me you
will help me in teaching her to care for me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All I can reply, Mr. Davis, is that my first
concern is and shall be the happiness of Bess,&#8221;
and Mrs. West left him with this rather unsatisfactory
reply.</p>

<p>The boat was now quite a distance out into
the blue waters of the lake, and already Wild
Horse Island was in sight. The day was beautifully
clear and warm, and only a slight breeze
stirred the tiny waves. The boat swung to the
left and began to go up the big arm of the Lake,
which in itself is a large-sized body of water. At
Dayton Creek they waited a few moments while
more passengers were taken aboard, and Bess
was drawn from her couch to watch some fine
horses being taken on the boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is one that looks like Mauchacho,&#8221; she
said to Mrs. West, whom she thought was standing
beside her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Please, may I talk to you now? There are a
number of interesting things which I would like
to point out to you, if I may,&#8221; said a low voice
quite near her.</p>

<p>Bess could not resist the little appeal which
the tone gave without being rude, and with rather
a forced smile she permitted Mr. Davis to
stand beside her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those horses are being taken to Kalispell for
the Fourth of July celebration. They have some
good races. Will you be there to see them, Miss&#8212;Bess?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no! We are only to be there for a day
or two. Some of Mrs. West&#8217;s friends are coming
to the <em>HW</em> Ranch during the July celebration
which the Indians are to have. I shall save all
my shouts for the races then, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Presently we shall come to the famous &#8216;Picture
Rocks,&#8217;&#8221; said Davis, during their conversation.
Not a word had he said save some remark
about the horses or the scenery, as they passed an
interesting place.</p>

<p>As the boat neared the rocks it slowed so that
the passengers might get a better view of the pictures.
Here, on the flat surface of a cliff, which
rises abruptly out of the water for a hundred
feet, are quaint tracings made by the Indians,
many, many, years ago. Horses, deer, moose and
other animals are clearly drawn. Numerous lines
near a deer record the successful hunt. Several
buffalos were clearly outlined and other drawings
which could not be defined. How it was possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
that these records have stood the ravages
of time is not known.</p>

<p>Bess was so interested that as the boat resumed
its journey she asked Mr. Davis for more
information concerning the strange and wonderful
pictures. He led her to some comfortable
chairs, and so interested did she become in the
stories which he told that she almost forgot her
chaperon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, I must go and find Mrs. West,&#8221; said
Bess, as she arose from her seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a moment,&#8221; ventured Mr. Davis, as he
touched her hand restrainingly. &#8220;First, I want
to ask you, why did you resist me as I came onto
the boat? You knew I was near; why did you
not turn?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bess drew her hand from his tightening clasp,
and pushing back the hair from her eyes, said:
&#8220;Because, Mr. Davis, you thought you could
make me turn and answer your call, and I wanted
you to know that I could control my own
will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear&#8212;did you say you heard me call?
Indeed, I had not uttered a sound! Some day&#8212;you
will not try so hard to resist me, nor to make
yourself believe that which you know is not true.
May I see you, if only for a moment, while you
are in Kalispell?&#8221; he continued, but before he
could catch the reply the girl had run out to
where she saw Mrs. West with some other
ladies.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />
<span class="medium">&#8220;MON DESIR&#8221; AND THE BOX OF ROSES</span></h2>


<p>&#8220;It does seem so good to be home again where
it is cool and clean and cozy,&#8221; said Bess, as she
flung herself into an easy porch chair the morning
of their return from the County-seat. She
scanned with interest the tall, magnificent pines
and firs which bordered the lake, as if she had
been away from them months instead of days. A
half-drawn glove was held in her clasp, as she
lifted her hands to her eyes better to discern
some horsemen whom she saw in the distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Little Mother,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;come quickly; I
believe those are the boys returning!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. West came hurrying out with a pair of
field glasses, and soon the two were hastening out
of the gate and down the road to see &#8220;the boys.&#8221;
For a moment they were out of sight behind the
low hill, then suddenly, a single horseman came
into sight, riding swiftly toward them. In a moment
more Henry West sprang to the ground
and held both his mother&#8217;s hands as he pressed
his tanned and roughened cheek against hers.</p>

<p>Turning to Bess with the gladness of return
shining in his eyes and ringing from his voice, he
said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span> &#8220;Oh, it seems so good to be home again!
We had a long, hard siege of it this trip. But
where are you going?&#8221; as he noticed she still
wore her hat.</p>

<p>Bess had suddenly burst into hysterical
laughter. She could not reply. His mother explained
that they had just returned from Kalispell
and that she was glad they were at home
when he arrived. Just then James Fletcher with
several of the cowboys came riding up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, little sister, are you so glad to see us
that you can&#8217;t control your laughing?&#8221; said
James, jumping from his horse and giving Bess
such a hearty squeeze that she gasped for breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, Henry, if you could see how funny
you look with that&#8212;that little goatee, I guess
you call it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Henry gave the whiskers a stroke or two, and
replied in a joking manner entirely foreign to
himself, &#8220;You see, &#8216;noblesse oblige&#8217;. I was chosen
foreman of the round-up, and so grew this to
give me dignity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Henry could not have carried on the
round-up had not the boys been awed by the
whiskers,&#8221; added James, looking at Henry, and
they both laughed as numerous jokes recurred to
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;To say the least, they are awful, don&#8217;t you
think so, little Mother? Please boys, go hurry
and shave and look like yourselves again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The long, delightful afternoon was spent in
lounging in the hammock or resting in the quiet,
cool rooms. Bess sang for the boys and they listened,
as if they had been isolated for months.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Presently James fell asleep, and Henry moved
nearer to the piano where he could watch the
girl&#8217;s face as she sang. Song after song fell in
soft cadences from her lips and held the man entranced.
How dear she looked in the simple
white dress, with some wild rose-buds in the knot
of hair at her neck. Tiny, stray locks half hid
her eyes and made them a soft, deep brown. Now
she began the low, indecisive minor of Nevins&#8217;
&#8216;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon Desir</i>,&#8217; and as her rich, melodious voice
framed the words, an involuntary sigh escaped
the man who stood so near her. Stretching out
his hand he placed it abruptly over hers on the
piano, and with a trembling voice and eyes brilliant
with emotion asked Bess to cease.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Henry&#8212;your favorite song,&#8221; said
Bess, astonished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not today&#8212;I can&#8217;t&#8212;hear&#8212;it&#8212;today.&#8221; He
turned abruptly and quitted the room.</p>

<p>James stirred and stretched his arms with a
yawn, saying, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I just hear you sing &#8216;My
Desire&#8217;, sister? Go on, finish it!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Bess, rising from the seat, closed the
music, gently and tenderly, as if she were concealing
some sacred thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not today; I could not sing it again&#8212;today.&#8221;
Going through the open door she sought
the splashing spring near the house, where she
sat dreaming and wondering&#8212;wondering at the
strange moods of Henry West. The shadows of
the trees were lengthening perceptibly, and a tiny
chill in the air warned her that it must be nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
dinner time. She stooped to bathe her face in
the clear, cold stream, where it flowed through
the hewn trough, and at once felt refreshed,
bright and alert. By the time she reached the
house she was unconsciously singing, and as the
words&#8212;&#8220;Give me my desire&#8221; arose to her lips she
felt rather than heard a deep sigh which came
from behind the swaying curtains of the living-room.
As she entered through the open door, she
saw Henry West, reclining in a large chair, his
hands clasped together above his head, in a restful
attitude. All traces of the round-up were
gone, save the deep brown of the sunburn on his
face, which made him look almost as dark as a
full blooded Indian, and contrasted strangely
with the soft, white, silk shirt.</p>

<p>As Bess came near with a sweet smile lighting
up her face, she asked, half coaxingly, &#8220;I wonder
if you and James are too tired, or have ridden too
much during the past three weeks, to go with me
for a ride after dinner? We can go after the
mail, and then cross on the ferry and ride over to
the falls. They must be magnificent now that the
water is so high. I could hear them roar as we
came through Polson this morning. Mauchacho
has not had his saddle on for days.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had not noticed until now how really
tired and worn out the man looked. Three weeks
of constant riding is a hard task, even for those
who, one might say, live in the saddle. To have
charge of the round-up; to manage successfully
and skilfully the driving and separating of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
thousands of cattle and the correct branding of
the calves; to see that each man performs his especial
duty and his share and is not behind some
protecting hill sitting on the ground, digging his
spurs into the ground, watching his horse eat
grass while the other &#8220;boys&#8221; are driving the cattle
to the branding corrals; to do all these and
many more duties dependent upon him, completely
used up all of West&#8217;s reserve force.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8212;there&#8212;never mind&#8212;don&#8217;t say &#8216;yes&#8217;;
really, I am selfish to forget how tired you both
must be, indeed,&#8221; continued Bess anxiously, as
West, with effort, lowered his arms and drew
himself together. She took one of the rose-buds
from her hair and carelessly fastened it in a
button-hole of his shirt. The faint perfume arose
to his nostrils, and for a moment made him quiver,
as if he were cold. He gripped the arms of
the chair, that his hands might not, against his
will, clasp the girl and draw her down to him
and hold her there forever. &#8220;Give me my desire,
and then let me die,&#8221; the words of the sad, tragic
song leaped to his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, Bess,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;James is quite
worn out. He stood the round-up splendidly,
and although I tried to give him easy shifts he
insisted upon doing his share. I will go with
you for a ride, and am not tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Henry, we will just stay at home, and
you and James shall tell me all about the experiences
of the past few weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they went into the dining-room a large box<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
was at Bess&#8217; place at the table. Her face and
neck dyed crimson as she caught sight of it, for
well she knew what it contained and who was the
sender. She would have placed it aside, but
James and Mrs. West coaxingly demanded to see
the contents. Her trembling fingers could scarcely
untie the cord. Henry, who sat beside her,
offered his assistance, and as she removed the
cover and green, waxen paper and lifted the
large, white roses to her face, a card fell at Henry&#8217;s
plate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! a card too! Let&#8217;s see, Henry, who it is
that sent the conservatory,&#8221; cried James, who
never missed an opportunity to tease his sister.
But Henry, without even glancing at the card,
placed it among the flowers which Bess held in
her arms. Her first impulse was to flee, but instead,
she stood up straight and firm, and with
an impulsive gesture gave the card to Mrs. West.
&#8220;Read, Mother,&#8221; demanded the girl, &#8220;and tell
who sent these and many others to us,&#8221; with especial
emphasis on the last word.</p>

<p>&#8220;This time, dearie, I fear we are not in partnership.
James, you know who sent the roses;
the card reads, &#8216;To my sweetheart,&#8217;&#8221; said Mrs.
West softly, as she again replaced the card.</p>

<p>&#8220;I congratulate you Miss&#8212;Bess,&#8221; remarked
Henry, his face suddenly grown pale.</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I, Sister; Davis is a bully good fellow,
I think, and I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;d make a great brother,&#8221;
added James before the girl could speak the
words of expostulation which rushed to her lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>She crushed the roses to her breast and a
shower of white petals fell to the floor. One fluttered
against West&#8217;s hand, and he started as if
a poisonous insect stung him.</p>

<p>Mrs. West quickly saw the girl&#8217;s deep confusion
and came to her aid, remarking that the
two were rather hasty in their congratulations,
which, as yet, were most inopportune.</p>

<p>As Bess seated herself, she let the roses slide
unheeded from her lap to the floor. Henry West
stooped, lifted the now bruised and broken blossoms,
and going into the living-room placed them
upon the folded copy of <cite>Mon Desir</cite>, as gently and
as reverently as if they were laid upon the silent
breast of a lost and dead love.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<span class="medium">BESS FLETCHER&#8217;S NEW GUN, AND ITS FIRST VICTIM</span></h2>


<p>West was standing near a tall pine tree, fastening
a small square of white paper against it
with a pin. James stood near, holding a 38
Smith and Wesson in his hands. Bess stood back
some fifteen yards with a 22-caliber repeating
rifle rested across her left arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;She said she did, Henry,&#8221; said James as he
lifted his eye-brows in a smile of incredulity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I did yesterday&#8212;hit the mark, not only
three but four times, if you please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the test is at hand. You have to &#8216;show
us&#8217; Sister, before we can &#8216;deliver the goods.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Twice had the pin dropped from West&#8217;s
fingers, but the third attempt had securely fastened
the target in place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, then, Bess, three holes within an inch
apart, and only three shots,&#8221; said West, as he
stepped aside. James ran and concealed himself
behind a tree, as if he really feared being shot.</p>

<p>For a moment Bess stood still, lifted the gun,
examined it to see that the cartridges were all
right, adjusted the sights correctly, and then
with a firm, decisive movement placed the weapon
against her shoulder. A sharp report and one
mark was recorded; the click of the lever and
another shot, and then the third. She stood with
the butt of the gun resting on her foot, as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
watched eagerly as both boys hurried forward
to view the record. Both were pointing and
measuring and talking. She heard James say
&#8220;not quite&#8221; and West replied &#8220;near enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it is not correct, I have lost,&#8221; said Bess, as
she started towards the tree. She found two
holes together and the third a little more than
one inch to the left.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take one more shot, Bess; I know you can
hit it,&#8221; said West, as he assured himself that the
gun was loaded and handed it back to the girl.
Bess resumed her position, and the next shot cut
directly between the other two, making one large
mark on the paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; cried both the boys at once, and they
came laughingly forward to present her the pretty
new weapon. James cleared his throat preparatory
to making a presentation speech, and as
the words &#8220;In behalf of&#8221; were said, Bess threw
her arms about his neck and then placed both her
hands over his mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, Henry, it is a perfect beauty,&#8221; said
Bess, as she accepted the gun. As she read engraved
on one side of the handle, her name, &#8220;Bess
Fletcher&#8221; and on the other, <em>HW</em> brand, she extended
her hand and happy tears filled her eyes.</p>

<p>Both men demanded that she give the pistol a
trial, and both were really astonished to see how
quickly she used it and how accurate were her
aim and judgment of distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;See, I have the pocket in my skirt all ready
for it,&#8221; and the gun slid into the ingenious opening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
near the waist, leaving only the handle inconspicuously
exposed. &#8220;You see, I was determined
to win, although I really cannot see what possible
use it can ever be to me. I could not bear to
shoot a bird, and as far as defense, what can
harm me, Henry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have carried a gun here on the range always,&#8221;
remarked West, as he drew one from his
holster, &#8220;and I have never used it but once, and
that was to shoot a rattlesnake which put up a
fight. See, here are the rattles,&#8212;eleven and the
button.&#8221; Taking off his hat he showed the interested
pair where he wore it on his hat-band.
&#8220;Another time I had it drawn and cocked, but,&#8221;&#8212;he
paused; &#8220;but&#8212;I replaced it.&#8221; Bess saw
him bite his lip as if the memory of the incident,
even, filled him with hate. Neither asked what
the occasion was, but as he carefully looked at
the weapon his face told them that he might use
it again. He thrust it back into its leathern receptacle,
giving the holster a firm pat, as if to assure
himself the gun was secure&#8212;and ready.</p>

<p>Bess had remounted her horse and gone back
to the house to show the prize to Mrs. West. As
she left them, James turned to West, who was re-adjusting
one of his stirrups before remounting.
The three had come a short distance from the
house for the shooting exhibition, and now James
and West were going on to gather up some running
horses which he wished to get in shape for
the races to be held within the next few days.</p>

<p>&#8220;Henry,&#8221; began James, as he walked to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
man standing near Eagle, &#8220;why can&#8217;t you tell me
what troubles you? You are not like your old
self, not one bit. I have seen it ever since my return,
and of late your mood is becoming worse.
Is it anything which I could help&#8212;if it is, tell
me, and you know I&#8217;ll do anything under God&#8217;s
sun to help you, old boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>He placed a friendly arm about the dark,
silent man&#8217;s shoulder, and with a gentle pat or
two rested it there. He noted the sudden dilation
of the wide nostrils, heard the teeth as they
ground together and caught a hopeful expression
in the dark, deep eyes as they were lifted to his
face for a moment.</p>

<p>As if to arouse the man from a dream, James
gave his broad shoulder another pat, at which
West straightened himself and grasped James&#8217;
hand in his, in a strong grip.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;You, Jim, are and have been my truest, best
friend. Ever since that first night at Harvard
have you been more to me than a brother. My
trouble is something which even God could not
help. Part of it is past, part is still to come.
The past cannot be forgotten, the future is inevitable,&#8212;I
must face it and&#8212;alone. I could not
tell you without causing you unnecessary pain,
and believe me, I should ask your help, if you
could help me. Never mind my moods. I try
hard enough to brace up before your sister and
my mother, but I know that sometimes I fail miserably.
Give me your hand again, Jim, and know&#8212;that
when I can or must tell you, nothing shall
prevent my seeking you and your confidence.&#8221;</p>

<p>He put his foot in the stirrup and swung with
easy grace into his saddle. James mounted and
rode beside him, trying in vain to think of something
to say which might relieve the awkward silence.
Either West did not see another rider approaching
them, or else he purposely reined
Eagle from the hard, beaten road, across the
prairie. In response to a signal from the horseman,
James called to West. &#8220;Henry, Davis is
signaling to us. Come back and see what he
wants.&#8221;</p>

<p>Already Fletcher had started back and was
talking with Davis when West came up slowly.
He touched his hat as the Indian Agent looked up
at him, and noting that the conversation did not
concern him he let Eagle nibble at the grass at
some little distance, while he waited for James.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, Fletcher; I shall do as you suggest,&#8221;
came to West&#8217;s ears, as he looked up to see
James returning and Davis going on&#8212;he knew to
his home to see the one whom he himself loved
more than all the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know, Henry,&#8221; said James, &#8220;I think
Davis is a fine man. He just asked my consent to
visit my sister and try to win her for his wife. I
told him that as far as I was concerned, he might
do so, but that Bess could and would please herself.
In fact, I told him that she did not seem
to care for anyone&#8217;s addresses.&#8221;</p>

<p>West could not reply, his heart and lips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
seemed suddenly frozen. If he only could warn
this brother against that man! Yet, how could
he without revealing the deep secret of his heart?
Unless he stated facts Fletcher might think it
was some personal affair which prompted his
criticism of Davis. And yet, to let Bess fall directly
into the talons of a vulture without even
lifting his voice to defend her, seemed the height
of cowardice. He must have time to think&#8212;to
think.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mauchacho, with his saddle on, was standing
at the gate waiting for his mistress to resume her
ride. He gave a long neigh of welcome as Mr.
Davis came riding up. Bess ran to the door to
see what Mauchacho wanted, just as Mr. Davis
leaped to the ground and started through the
gate. With a little ejaculation of surprise she
stepped down toward him. She knew that if she
could have escaped without being seen, she would
not now be shaking hands with this man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Fletcher told me I should find you here,
and he assured me that you would be glad to see
me,&#8221; he said. He did not look directly at her as
he exaggerated the truth. &#8220;Are you not glad, little
girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>Since the evening when the white roses had
come and the card had been read to the others,
Bess had not felt so confused nor embarrassed
when Davis had been spoken of. Now that James
and Henry and Mrs. West knew that Davis cared
for her and that he came purposely to see her, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
tried to overcome her aversion for the man.
While he was near her he exerted an influence
which, strive as she would, she could not resist.
His manner was charming, his conversation interesting,
and there was about him that subtle,
indescribable something which made him well-nigh
irresistible. Bess was even surprised at
herself as she became more and more interested
in the man. And yet when he was gone she always
felt relieved and happier, as if she were
freed from some undue constraint. She never
longed for him to come again and always felt a
surprise when he came, and an insane desire to
run away to hide. As she did not reply to his
question, he asked again, &#8220;Is my sweetheart glad
to see me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, Mr. Davis, your conjecture is rather
bold! Did I ever say I was anyone&#8217;s sweetheart?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you are, you are mine, and just now
your brother congratulated me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, indeed,&#8221; said Bess, haughtily; &#8220;is a
girl compelled to assume the role, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nolens volens</i>?&#8221;
Her brown eyes snapped defiance at the man
standing a few steps below her.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, Bess, no one will compel you to do
anything against your own will,&#8221; quickly corrected
Mr. Davis, for he did not wish his too slow
progress to be retarded by any whim or imagined
compulsion. He had had experience enough to
know that with women, coaxing accomplishes
more than commands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Come, I came to take you for a ride. I see
you were intending to go anyway,&#8221; he said
tactfully. Half reluctantly she permitted
him to lead her to the gate and assist her in
mounting. Immediately, as she felt her horse under
her, her usual happy spirit returned and in a
short time she was laughing and merry as could
be. The warm breeze blew her white veil about
her face and tossed her hair about in sweet confusion.
What a picture they made as their horses
moved swiftly along in rhythmic motion! He sat
his horse well and rode without any awkwardness,
now that his ankle was strong once more.
It seemed to him that he had never seen such
perfect grace before, as he saw how beautifully
the girl rode her splendid horse.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it were not so hot down across the flat,&#8221;
said Bess, &#8220;I would show you that Mauchacho
can go twice as fast as that cayuse you are riding,&#8221;
and the twinkle in her eye was inconsistent
with her assumed, contemptuous smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the first ride we have had together
for so long that I could not bear to hurry it,&#8221; replied
Davis, as he placed a restraining hand on
Mauchacho&#8217;s bridle.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to be growing dreadfully hot! Go
to the right beyond those rocks and we shall find
shade and a spring,&#8221; said the girl, as she noticed
tiny beads of sweat trickling down the horses&#8217;
necks.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Mauchacho, who was leading, gave
a quick snort and sprang sidewise into the air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
and landed several feet to the side of the trail,
nearly throwing Bess from the saddle. Astonished
at the unusual performance of her horse,
she glanced quickly about to discern the cause of
this fear. The next instant she snatched the 38
Smith and Wesson from her skirt and a sharp
crack sounded as the shot created a squirming,
writhing mass in the trail only a few feet in
front of her. Davis&#8217; horse had also become
frightened at the coiled rattler and was now almost
uncontrollable. Bess sprang from Mauchacho,
who had the sense to know that the snake
was now harmless, firing another shot into the
quivering streaks of drab and it lay still.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, upon my word, Miss Fletcher, I take
off my hat to you!&#8221; said Davis, as he succeeded
in quieting his horse. &#8220;Who taught you to be
such a &#8216;crack shot&#8217; and where did you get that
pretty gun? Where did you conceal it, may I
ask?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, cut the rattles off for me and put
them in my hat-band, Mr. Davis! This is the
first thing I&#8217;ve shot with my pistol which Henry
West gave me only today as a present, because I
had learned to shoot so well under his directions,&#8221;
answered the excited girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eleven rattles and a button! Just like his!&#8221;
She could not resist a tiny shudder of aversion as
she placed the sombrero with its new decoration
upon her head. Yet she knew that Henry West&#8217;s
face would light up with gratification when he
saw her trophy.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />
<span class="medium">MAUCHACHO WINS THE RACE</span></h2>


<p>&#8220;Come, folks, hurry, hurry! I can hear the
Indians&#8217; drums already!&#8221; cried Bess, as she ran
through the hall and downstairs.</p>

<p>Several guests who had come from Kalispell
the day before to see the Indian celebration were
with Mrs. West in the living-room.</p>

<p>James Fletcher and Henry West, together
with the other gentlemen of the party, were waiting
at the gate with several extra saddle horses.
Mrs. West expected to drive and call for Mrs.
White on the way through Polson. The site selected
for the various races and Indian dances
was on a level stretch of county South and East
from Polson. As the merry party mounted their
horses and started they soon came in sight of the
large crowd which had already congregated.
The incessant muffled sound of the tom-toms or
the loud cry of an Indian, came to their ears as
they urged the horses so that they might not miss
any of the performances.</p>

<p>The first sight which attracted them was a
number of squaws and bucks who were seated on
either side of a log rapping upon it with sticks.
The squaws sang in weird monotones in time
with their sounding sticks; and occasionally a
buck joined them for a few notes as if to give the
song a greater impetus. With a swift motion and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
a sharp cry one of the bucks pointed with his
stick at another Indian who sat opposite him
only further down the line. Instantly the music
(if indeed it could be called music) ceased, and
each one in this gambling game looked expectantly
to see if the Indian designated held in his hand
the piece of bone which had been passed deftly,
and with no little sleight of hand, from one to another.
A look of sheer disappointment came into
his face, however, and he placed a forfeit with
the opposing side. Again the song and drumming
were resumed more vigorously than before,
the result this time was that one of the bucks
arose, removed his blanket and stalked away,
amid calls and words of derision and laughter
from the others.</p>

<p>West suggested that the party move on and
seek some shady place where they might rest and
view the dances. They had not long to wait, for
presently they saw marching towards them a
long file of brilliantly dressed Indians, squaws,
papooses and larger children. The squaws were
gorgeous in flaming reds and yellows, in purple
velvet or red satin, in greens and even one in
pink, with floating ribbons and flashing beads
and ornaments. They sang in high, shrill tones
to the accompaniment of the tom-tom, which was
carried by four stalwart bucks beating vigorously
and marching ahead.</p>

<p>The Indians in the procession now began
forming a circle with the squaws and the drummers
in the center where they squatted upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
ground. Now the tom-toms assumed a different
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">tempo</i>, the nasal, piercing singing of the squaws
began anew, and simultaneously, at a certain note
in the music, all the Indians began the dance. To
some, it looked like a confused mass of bending,
jumping, moving beings, each of whom seemed
bent upon going through the greatest contortions.
But when one observed closely it was seen
that at a certain beat of the drum the heels came
to the ground, then the toes or the whole foot.
Their bodies moved forward and backward in
graceful savagery. See their gorgeous blankets
sway! How the festoons of feathers and fixings
wave with each movement of their supple bodies;
watch the interested expression on the faces! See
that tall, slender buck with a whirl of eagle feathers
hanging down his back; hear the bells about
his ankles as they jingle in perfect rhythm to the
song and drum! Now he has bent forward till
the feathers in his hair sweep the dust! Backward
he sways and his knees fairly touch his
face! See his eyes gleam, how eager is his whole
face! How his hands lift high the war implement
with its decoration of eagle feathers!</p>

<p>But hark, the music ceases, and at one shrill
note the dancers stop. Already each brow is
dripping with beads of sweat. Now one Indian,
straight, strong, lithe of limb, steps alone upon
the trodden circle. The sun makes his almost
nude body gleam like burnished copper and dazzles
the beads upon his belt and bracelets. A
large war bonnet of weasel skins and eagle feathers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
with two curved buffalo horns, covers his
head and falls down his back till it nearly touches
the ground. Bells tinkle upon his moccasins and
at his wrists. As he steps out from among the
others, cries of approval are heard upon all sides,
and Bess knows that he must be some extraordinary
Indian. Turning to West she asked who
the Indian was, who was about to dance, and
what the dance was to be.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is Two Feathers, and is noted for his
wonderful dancing. This is to be the snake
dance, I think,&#8221; replied Henry West, as he moved
Mauchacho to a better position for the benefit of
Bess. Glancing about to see that his guests also
had a good view, he rode Eagle over to the carriage
where his mother and several other ladies
were seated. Assuring himself that they were
comfortable and could see the sport, he started
to return to Bess&#8217; side when he saw to his chagrin
that Mr. Davis, the Indian Agent, had just assumed
that position. The girl greeted Mr. Davis,
and was introducing him to her companions,
when she noticed West standing aloof from the
others. In response to a gesture from her he
came quickly to her side. &#8220;Please stay here, Henry;
I want you to tell me about the dances.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reluctant though he was to be near Davis
and to be compelled to speak with him, he did as
she requested. Dismounting, he leaned an arm
across the saddle, and only occasionally lifted his
face to Bess&#8217; in response to her questions during
the dance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>But she was now all absorbed in the graceful
undulations of the dancer. See how he stretches
out his neck and writhes his body like a huge reptile,
curving now to the right, till his face nearly
touches his shoulder, and swiftly moving forward
and again to the left, in long, gliding vibrations!
Some of his manoeuvers were so suggestive of a
living snake, that Bess could feel her flesh creep.
When the music increased, the singing of the
squaws shrieked higher and shriller, the dancer
thrust forth his head and hissed. She impulsively
threw up her hands which came in unexpected
contact with the decoration on her sombrero. She
gave a little, nervous scream as she felt the rattles
quiver under her touch. West glanced quickly
at her and asked anxiously if she were ill. Before
she could reply, however, Davis said, &#8220;Really
Bess, this exhibition of savagery is rather hard
on your nerves. Let me take you away!&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked with insolent eyes at Henry West
who met the gaze without a tremor of the eyelashes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not that which made me act so silly. I
unconsciously touched these things on my hat
and they always send the shivers through me. I
could not bear them at all, except that they are
my first trophy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you coming with me?&#8221; asked Davis, as
he began to turn his horse&#8217;s head.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no; for see, all the others are now joining
Two Feathers in the snake ceremony! See!
even those small boys are dancing like old warriors!&#8221;</p>

<p>Forward and backward swayed the circle of
dancers, undulating in and out past each other;
bending their bodies low towards the ground
with a creeping movement until they seemed like
a huge, squirming mass of bright colored and
winged reptiles. In measured tread they danced,
they swayed, they moved, in perfect time to the
singing of the squaws and the hollow sounding
drum. Their heels struck the earth with such
unison that one could feel the vibrations. Would
they never tire?</p>

<p>West asked to be excused, as he wished to prepare
his horses for the relay race which was to
begin later. The fact was, he felt himself growing
hot and angry in Davis&#8217; presence and feared
that something might occur to make him lose his
self-control. Once during the conversation Davis
had asked Henry West why he had not joined in
the dance. Bess did not see the smiling sneer as
he asked the question, and consequently thought
it was only meant for a joke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fancy Henry dancing with the Indians and
with a blanket on,&#8221; laughed Bess, as she patted
him on the shoulder and looked at him with
saucy, smiling eyes from under her fluffy hair.
She could not know that the malicious remark
of Davis cut West like a knife, and did not understand
that the purport of the words was&#8212;&#8220;why
do you not go where you belong instead of mingling
with white people.&#8221; For a brief moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
West looked at Davis, who quickly turned his
face; then he said carelessly and indifferently,
&#8220;I know all those dances, Miss Bess, and perhaps
some day you may be applauding me instead of
Two Feathers.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he lifted his broad-brimmed hat to her and
the others in the party, he sprang to the saddle
with one easy swing of his leg, reined Eagle
abruptly about and started swiftly away. Davis
looked at Bess as she watched Henry West, feeling
no little chagrin at her look. She seemed to
lose interest in the dances now that he was gone,
and though Davis tried to point out the especial
features of the Sun dance and Medicine dance,
she watched them half-interestedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come&#8212;let us see if the others have not had
quite enough by this time,&#8221; said Bess, after the
Indians had given two more long, fantastic
dances.</p>

<p>As the horses were brought out for the relay
race, and the party moved to be nearer the track
Bess again became filled with excitement. James
had explained to her that this race was ten miles,
or around the half-mile track twenty times; there
were three entries and each rider could have
three horses. They were to change horses, re-saddle
and remount unassisted, except that
some one could help in holding the horses after
each mile. The rider completing in the quickest
time, of course, won the prize. Bess had only eyes
for Henry West as he led his horses down the
track to the starting point. One horse was already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
saddled, and walking by West&#8217;s side was
the Indian who was to ride his horses.</p>

<p>Presently the other men with their horses and
riders were ready. The three Indians mounted;
the crowd was waved back out of the way; everyone
grew expectant and interested. At the crack
of a pistol the horses were off like a flash amid
clouds of dust. Evidently they were not new at
this kind of racing and were eager for the sport.
As they sped around the track they were almost
abreast, and as the mile was nearly run West&#8217;s
horse was a length behind the other two. As
they neared the wire where each horse was being
held ready to receive its saddle and respective
rider, each slackened his pace and now simultaneously
the three riders slid from their horses,
quickly unbuckled the saddles, flung them upon
the waiting horses, and with quick and sure fingers
girted them, remounted and were off! Swift
Arrow, the Indian riding for West, had changed
his saddle so quickly that his horse was ready to
start when the others were. This second horse
kept apace with the others and toward the end of
the half mile was gaining slightly. One of the
other horses suddenly bolted off the track, and
by the time the rider had him under control he
was at least a quarter behind. Again at the
change Swift Arrow&#8217;s deft fingers had adjusted
the saddle, remounted and was off before the second
Indian had fairly gained his feet. On and
on they rode, first one gaining, then the other
ahead according to the fleetness of the horses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
How the crowd cheered as the favorite horse
came in ahead! How they shouted as Louie
pounded his heels into the horse&#8217;s sides in vain!
See, here he comes at last, a half lap behind the
other two, with his shirt flopping in the wind and
one of his leggings hanging down over the stirrup.
As he passes the man who holds his horses
the legging is caught and jerked free. Again the
others have remounted and gone, as Louie comes
steaming up, half falling as the other loosened
legging dangles at his feet. His long braids have
become untied, and now the black, straight hair
with its single feather is standing straight out
with the breeze. Nothing daunted, with his fleeing
companions already nearly a mile ahead, he
bends low over his horse and rides as only an Indian
can. Seven miles are run! Swift Arrow
still leading! The eighth begun! Look! What
attracts West, as he runs hurriedly across the
track? His keen eye caught a glimpse of the saddle
as Swift Arrow sped past! See, now, it is
surely loose! Will he be able to hold until the
end of the mile? Here he comes dashing forward!
Already he seems to be beginning to dismount!
Look. The horse suddenly turns, and
the loosened saddle with the rider are flung to
the ground almost at West&#8217;s feet! The frightened
horse plunges and is gone. Two men quickly
draw the stunned Indian to one side and
shouts of &#8220;West! West!&#8221; are heard coming from
the excited crowd.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Will he be able to finish the race,&#8221; cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Bess, excitedly to James, who stood near Mauchacho.</p>

<p>&#8220;His other two horses cannot stand it to run
alternately now, surely,&#8221; replied her brother,
&#8220;and already both the others are ahead! See,
here comes Nedreau&#8217;s horse on the finish of the
eighth, and West has still the last half of the
eighth to go. He might as well give up.&#8221;</p>

<p>West had assured himself that Swift Arrow
was not seriously injured, and then lifting his
sombrero to the calling crowd, snatched the saddle
from the ground, threw it upon the resisting
horse, fastened it, leaped upon the horse and was
off! His head fairly touched the horse&#8217;s neck as
he bent over, and in a steady voice urged the animal
into even greater speed! Nedreau&#8217;s rider
was already mounted and off as West came up
the half-mile with Louie not far behind. He re-saddled
to begin the ninth mile, but the tired,
restive horse did not gain a foot over the others.
Bess could not sit still in her saddle. &#8220;That is
not fair,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;for they have three horses
and Henry only two!&#8221; She saw with trepidation
that his horse was falling far behind, and knew
that he could not go much farther.</p>

<p>Before any of her companions was aware of
her purpose, Bess gave Mauchacho a quick cut
with the quirt and flew across the intervening
space to the man holding West&#8217;s horse ready for
the remount. Bess sprang to the ground, unfastened
and jerked off the saddle and thrust the
reins into the man&#8217;s hands just as West came up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
He had seen the girl as he neared the wire, and
quickly divined her purpose. She sprang back
out of the way and cried, &#8220;Take Mauchacho, take
my Bird! Win the race for me!&#8221;</p>

<p>At first the crowd could not see what was going
on, and when the girl&#8217;s purpose dawned upon
them they cheered and shouted wildly. Cries of
&#8220;Ride,&#8221; &#8220;Go win,&#8221; &#8220;Mount the Bird,&#8221; came to
the breed&#8217;s ears, and he threw his saddle upon the
anxious, eager animal and was off.</p>

<p>See how easily he starts; he even leans over to
pat the horse&#8217;s neck; he does not seem to care nor
to notice that Nedreau&#8217;s Indian is almost a half
ahead! Now he is bending low over the saddle
till man and horse seem one; neither hear the
cries and shouts as they begin the last half of the
race. On Mauchacho speeds&#8212;swiftly, steadily;
nearer, nearer, nearer the other horse! Almost
to the other&#8217;s tail! A leap and they are even! A
stretch, and his nose is ahead! One supreme
effort and daylight is between the two horses,
just as they pass under the wire amid frantic
cries, tossing hats and waving handkerchiefs. In
a moment the cheers were changed to laughter as
poor Louie came trotting under the wire, dressed
only in his feather, so strenuous had been his exertions.</p>

<p>Bess stood alone near the track, her hands
clasped together. Not even a cry escaped her lips
as she saw, not West, but Mauchacho win the
race.</p>

<p>As soon as West could slow the horse and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
bring him back before the judges, he heard the
starter announce that &#8220;West had won the race.&#8221;
West sprang to the ground, gave the reins to a
man standing near, and entered the judges&#8217;
stand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not win this race, gentlemen; I had
no right to take a fresh horse; the money goes to
Nedreau and Louie,&#8221; and before they could offer
any protest he had gone. As he led Mauchacho
over to the waiting and now smiling mistress,
West paused a moment as he heard the announcement
of the correction of the race, and felt relieved
as he saw the two Indians receive the
prize.</p>

<p>Bess flung her arms about Mauchacho&#8217;s neck
and happy tears filled her eyes. &#8220;You beauty! I
had no idea that you could go so like a bird! Oh,
you dear!&#8221; and she patted his neck and kissed his
nose just as the men threw a blanket over him
and led him away to be cooled off.</p>

<p>Henry West was just about to take Bess back
to her companions, when he turned and directly
faced Dave Davis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Bess&#8212;permit me to take you away
from here. What prompted you to do such a
strange thing? Besides, the race was unfair and
West did not win,&#8221; he said, as he glanced with
lowering eyes at the man by her side.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may not have been fair, Mr. Davis, but it
was a mighty fine race! I will go back to Mrs.
West with Henry, thank you,&#8221; and she gave him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
a queer smile as she left him, which he did not
quite understand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, little Mother&#8212;now, James, don&#8217;t
both of you look so. I just had to have Henry
win that race, even though it took Mauchacho
and me both to help him do it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sister, we can&#8217;t truthfully call you a
tenderfoot any longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long have you been in the West, Miss
Fletcher?&#8221; asked one of the company, as he
looked at the happy, satisfied expression on the
girl&#8217;s face. Bess turned her full, brown eyes to
the man&#8217;s face, but for the moment she did not
speak. Unconsciously she had slid her fingers
into Henry West&#8217;s brown hand as he stood near
to her, but did not heed its tremor nor faint pressure.
Then her eyes sought the deep, blue hills
with the soft masses of white, fleecy clouds crowning
their crests and the verdant pines caressing
their feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long! Oh, how long? When was I not
here? Here my heart has been since God&#8217;s divine
touch first made those hills! Here my soul
shall be when they have passed away!&#8221; replied
the girl, her head raised toward the deepening
shadows on the crests.</p>

<p>Then came the evening with its cool and
quiet; with its rest and peace; with its quivering
stars and pale radiance of the moon.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a><br />
<span class="medium">THE STRENGTH OF A BEADED BELT</span></h2>


<p>It was a beautiful morning toward the end of
August when Bess Fletcher donned her new
brown riding skirt, which her deft fingers had
just completed, and came out to her waiting
horse. The weather during the few previous
weeks had been unusually hot and dry, so that
riding had been anything but pleasant. James
and Henry had been busy with the hay crop, and
Mrs. West and Bess had spent the time with their
sewing and reading. During the night it rained,
a gentle, copious rain&#8212;the first in weeks. Everything
was refreshed, and everyone&#8217;s spirits were
aroused from enervation and lethargy. The girl
sniffed the fresh, scented air as she drew on her
riding gloves. How the perfume from the refreshed
pines and firs came floating across from
the hills! The great stacks of new hay emitted
an intoxicating odor, and busy bees buzzed about,
drunk with sweetness.</p>

<p>Mrs. West had come to the gate to make a request
just as Bess placed her foot into the stirrup
and was adjusting her divided skirt as she
seated herself in the saddle. Her well-groomed
horse shone like satin, and his dainty foot persistently
pawed the damp earth, impatient for a
run after his long confinement and rest. Bess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
leaned over and was patting the arched neck and
trying to quiet him with soft words as she gathered
from Mrs. West the several errands to be
done.</p>

<p>&#8220;And then, little Mother, after I have seen
Mrs. White for you, do you mind if I cross on the
ferry and ride over toward Paul Trahan&#8217;s ranch
to meet James and Henry on their return?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you quite sure, dear, that you can find
the place? It is at least ten miles from the
ferry,&#8221; replied Mrs. West, and in her voice rang
a solicitous tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes! You need not feel alarmed. I am
sure I could find the ranch, but most likely I&#8217;ll
meet the boys long before I reach it,&#8221; assured
Bess, as she touched Mauchacho with the quirt
and then threw a dainty kiss to the white-haired
woman whose face still wore an anxious look.</p>

<p>A sharp pang clutched at the gentle woman&#8217;s
heart as she watched the rider melting into the
distance. She had scarcely thought before that
sooner or later Bess might be so melting out of
her life&#8212;that life of which she had grown to be
such an integral part. How unconsciously had
her love grown day by day! How dependent had
she become upon the girl&#8217;s judgment and suggestions!
And yet, the day was surely inevitable
whose declining rays would not linger on a sweet,
girlish face near the window, but rather pierce a
woman&#8217;s heart with loneliness and pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;But then,&#8221; she thought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span> &#8220;it will be a long
time yet before Mr. Davis will take her away
and leave my arms empty once more, and doubly
lone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bess stood at her horse&#8217;s head patting his soft,
sleek nose as the Indian rowed them across the
Pend d&#8217;Oreille on the crude ferry boat. The
only other passengers were a round-faced, fat
squaw and two struggling papooses. At first
Bess was oblivious to everything about her, when
suddenly she was attracted by a shrill cry and
turned just in time to jump to the edge and
snatch a wet, wriggling bunch of humanity out
of the water. Such a jargon of words as were
meted out to the would-be voyager for his venturesomeness!</p>

<p>Bess quickly fastened Mauchacho&#8217;s bridle
about the railing and soon had the sobbing, bedraggled
victim snuggled in her arms. What did
it matter to her if his skin was red or his hair
matted! Was he not a baby in distress? The
squaw looked with interest and wonder at the
comforter; and finally when the howlings had
ceased and only nervous little sobs came forth
convulsively, she touched Bess on the arm and
motioned that she would take the child. It did
the girl&#8217;s heart good to see him snuggle down under
the folds of the bright blanket like a little
wet chicken seeking the warmth and comfort of
its mother&#8217;s wing.</p>

<p>Again, just as the nose of the ferry was scraping
on the pebbles at the landing, the squaw
touched Bess upon the arm. She could not resist
the silent appeal in the woman&#8217;s eyes as she held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
up for Bess&#8217; acceptance a beautifully beaded belt.
At first Bess quietly and smilingly pushed aside
the proffered gift, but the look of disappointment
given her caused her to relent, and then
she fastened it securely around her own trim
waist.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, very much; it shall always remind
me of you and the baby who nearly went
down the stream.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You love him papoose? You hold Injun
baby? You no care?&#8221; asked the woman, as she
saw with gratified eyes her treasure worn by the
white girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not care if he is a papoose&#8212;he is one
of God&#8217;s children,&#8221; Bess answered, and the
woman understood.</p>

<p>The little incident was soon quite out of the
girl&#8217;s mind, and only recurred as she touched the
belt with her fingers or felt its dangling ends beat
regularly against her side as Mauchacho galloped
across the range. She had never before been in
this direction, and all the hills and rocks held a
new interest for her. Several times she checked
her horse and slid quickly from her saddle to inspect
some odd-looking stones, or to pluck some
strange, new flower. Was not this tour of exploration
fine! Perhaps she might discover something
never seen nor heard of before! It surely
seemed as if no one had ever set foot here, and as
if she had come alone into an undiscovered and
unexplored land. What fun to feel such utter
isolation and possession! Riotous thoughts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
adventure and daring and possible danger surged
through the girl&#8217;s mind as her horse carried her
on and further on into new places and over
strange paths.</p>

<p>With a start she came out of her reverie, and
straightening up in the saddle began to wonder
at the time of day. Unheeded miles had passed
under Mauchacho&#8217;s hoofs, and the slanting sun
told her that the hour was late.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, the boys ought to be coming soon. I
am sure&#8212;that is, I feel almost certain this is
the right place. Still, it seems so far back to the
last ranch! Oh, well, I&#8217;ll just let Mauchacho nibble,
and I&#8217;ll take a look around that bunch of
thorn-apple shrubs.&#8221;</p>

<p>She began to sing softly and confidently as
she loosened the cinch and pulled the saddle and
blanket off the horse&#8217;s wet back. He shook himself
with a grunt of satisfaction and began at
once to seek out the most tender grasses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be a good boy till I come back, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;
Bess gave him a sounding slap on his wet shoulder
that caused him to lift his tail with a &#8220;please-don&#8217;t-bother-me&#8221;
flirt.</p>

<p>The sun was fervent and Bess walked hurriedly
on to reach the shade of the thorns. She
reached up and plucked some of the plump, ripe,
red thorn-apples, and enjoyed munching them as
she wandered idly on. Far ahead of her she discerned,
by shading her eyes with her hand, a
large herd of cattle. At first she could not tell if
they were being driven or whether they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
simply eating. As they created no clouds of dust
nor seemed to be coming any nearer she decided
it could not be the cattle she expected to meet being
driven by her brother and Henry. Just then
there flashed across her mind an almost forgotten
warning which Henry West had given her. Here
she was, almost upon a herd of wild cattle all
alone and off her horse! Had he not told her how
their curiosity was excited by seeing persons
afoot with often disastrous results, and warned
her to be sure and stay in the saddle if she were
near any of the grazing herds. Filled with sudden
alarm at her temerity she hurriedly retraced
her steps, only to be horrified to realize that she
could not tell where to go. The clumps of brush
now looked all alike and seemed only to be a confused
mass of limbs and leaves. There was the
declining sun towards which she had advanced,
so now she must retreat in the opposite direction.
Yes, but should she turn to the right or the left?</p>

<p>For a moment she stood trying to collect her
bewildered senses. She took her sombrero from
her dishevelled hair and gave a frightened scream
as her finger-tips came in contact with the rattles
which still adorned the band.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I just can&#8217;t bear those horrid things any
longer,&#8221; she cried and with a stick began to tear
her trophy off. She had not succeeded, however,
when her attention was attracted by a horseman
riding far to the left of her. How madly he was
riding, bending low over his horse till they
seemed like one! Bess watched the rider as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
rode on swiftly, then swerved to the left, then
back again. He was so indistinct in the hazy distance
that she could not tell whether he rode like
an Indian or a white man.</p>

<p>At first she felt an impulse to call, but she
knew her voice could not reach him at that distance.
Look, toward the sun! What is that? A
wall of smoke? A cloud of rolling, increasing
dust, mounting higher, higher, nearer, nearer,
and caused only by the rushing, fleeing hoofs of a
stampeding herd!</p>

<p>Frozen with terror the girl stood irresolute,
unable to decide whether to flee in the hope that
she might reach her horse or to try to seek safety
among the frail protection of the thorn shrubs!
She could feel the earth begin to tremble from the
rush of pounding hoofs and saw the ominous
cloud rolling nearer and nearer. There was no
time to flee; no chance to reach the trees; only
now could she rush to that projecting boulder
and cast her body close against it in the hope
that the frantic steers might not crumble it in
pieces in their mad onslaught.</p>

<p>What was that she heard? She hesitated an
instant as she neared the rock whose unpromising
shelter she sought. Surely she heard someone
calling her name. &#8220;Bess&#8212;Bess,&#8221; the agonized
tones came to her ears! Where from, from
whom came that ray of hope? Now she reached
the rock. Standing boldly upon it she placed her
hands to her lips in a rounded funnel and
screamed with all her strength, again and again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>Like a flash across and from out the cloud of
dust shot Eagle! She saw the red in his nostrils
as he leaped directly toward her, a fleck of foam
struck her face&#8212;and then&#8212;and then a vise
clutched the beaded buckskin belt; some Herculean
arm tore her from the pedestal and hot,
swiftly drawn breaths moistened her cheek and
neck. She felt herself flying through obscure
space! She felt her breath gripped out of her
body by some terrible, encircling pressure. What
dreadful creature held her in such a death-like
grip?</p>

<p>She lifted her hands and felt the rough bristles
on a man&#8217;s cheeks, then let them slide together
about his tense neck in a tenacious hold.
A firm, stirruped foot supported one of hers and
she let her weight settle upon it. Each breath
she drew was impregnated with stifling dust,
while surging in her ears was the bellowing of
frantic steers and thundering of a thousand
hoofs! Would those mad, fleeing creatures never
cease; would they never swerve; would they ever
keep gaining? What if Eagle should stumble!
What if his double burden should prove greater
than his strength? The terrifying thought made
the girl&#8217;s arms cling all the more firmly about
the rigid neck and made her heart beat with aching
throbs in her parched throat! She placed
her lips close to the man&#8217;s ear and in an agonized
and almost inaudible voice cried, &#8220;Hurry, for
God&#8217;s sake, hurry!&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly she felt the horse make a supreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
leap, another and yet more, till soon, through her
half-opened eyelids the girl could see that the
enveloping cloud of dirt and dust was falling behind.
Now a steady, even voice was saying,
&#8220;Slow, old boy! Easy, easy! All right Eagle;
take your time, boy! Slow, slow!&#8221; Bess could
feel the arm&#8217;s muscles relaxing with the slackening
speed of the horse; hear a deep, indrawn
breath of relief, and see through the dust-covered
hair which nearly veiled her face, a man&#8217;s features
o&#8217;er spread with grime, yet white with pallor.</p>

<p>As Eagle came to a stop she felt herself gently
lowered to the ground and supported by her
rescuer who dismounted at the same instant.
Lifting her hands whose fingers were still stiff
from their tenacity, she pushed the dishevelled
hair far back from her eyes and forehead and
stood gazing with thankfulness and gratitude
into the deep glowing eyes. No words came to
her lips nor was the silence broken by the passive
man. It seemed that hours had elapsed since
Eagle had been relieved of his burden, when a
nervous unnatural laugh came from the now
quivering lips of Bess.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very dusty for such a recent rain, isn&#8217;t
it?&#8221; came in a voice husky and high-strung.
&#8220;Henry&#8212;Henry&#8212;for pity&#8217;s sake speak to me, or
can&#8217;t,&#8212;don&#8217;t you see&#8212;see&#8212;that I, oh dear&#8212;I
know&#8212;I shall&#8212;c-r-y!&#8221; and already great tears
filled her eyes and began coursing down her
flaming cheeks through tiny streaks of mud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down here, Bess, till you feel rested.
Poor little girl&#8212;it was a dreadful ordeal, but you
are brave, braver than a man would have been.&#8221;</p>

<p>Henry West seated himself near the girl
whose whole being was torn with convulsive sobs.
She had thrown herself on the ground and buried
her face in her arms. How he longed to lift her
within his arms and hold her tightly until the
storm of loosened terror might cease! Could he
only have drunk the salty tears that rained upon
her face! Dared he only whisper in her ear all
his love and longing! He must&#8212;must! He
could not, would not be silent longer! She was
his very own now&#8212;his, saved from the mangling
blows of wild beasts. His heart pounded against
his throat demanding that its pleadings be given
voice! With a swift start and open arms he bent
over the trembling form. His fingers closed hard
till the skin was drawn tight over the knuckles!
His hands opened, slowly, appealingly&#8212;eager to
enfold their treasure, their right, but only the
tips of the fingers swept gently, softly across the
brown, disordered tresses. With the long, gentle
stroke the sobbing lessened and then at length
ceased.</p>

<p>Slowly the girl turned and faced the comforter
whose fingers still thrilled with the delicious
contact of the dear head and hair. She
sought in vain for a look or word of censure
which she imagined she deserved. Instead, a dark
face was all aglow with gratitude and love, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
deep eyes spoke the words which a guarded voice
dared not utter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Henry&#8212;see&#8212;blood on your spurs.
Look at Eagle&#8212;and yet once you told me that
you never rode him with spurs!&#8221;</p>

<p>As soon as his attention had been directed toward
the almost forgotten horse he walked swiftly
over to Eagle still quivering and trembling in
every limb.</p>

<p>&#8220;Old boy&#8212;was it a pretty hard run? Brace
up&#8212;don&#8217;t give up&#8212;you&#8217;re good for another,&#8221;
West was saying as he let his solicitous hands
touch here and there. Bess knew from his manner
that the horse was really sick, although he
tried to appear unconcerned. Henry began to
walk the horse about, and it made the girl&#8217;s heart
ache to see the splendid limbs move with stiffness
and pain. If there were only something she
could do to help!</p>

<p>On she walked, close to Henry West&#8217;s side,
now unconsciously touching the reins and now
patting the shoulder wet with beads of pain.
Suddenly&#8212;with an almost human cry the horse
gave a plunge and fell to the ground! West stood
aside&#8212;for a moment immovable and still&#8212;then
with a reluctant yet decisive movement drew his
gun from his holster. Bess sprang quickly to his
side and grasped both his arms with her own!
Thrusting up her face till her breath fanned his
cheek she cried, &#8220;Don&#8217;t&#8212;Henry&#8212;he shall not
die! All this just because I forgot your warning&#8212;because
I am a fool&#8212;a horrid&#8212;careless girl!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;He cannot live&#8212;I cannot bear to see him
suffer. I must&#8212;shoot&#8212;if&#8212;I&#8212;can!&#8221; Releasing
his right arm he drew the left one up and about
the girl&#8217;s head, and closing her ear with the palm
of his hand he held her tightly and closely to
him, her face completely buried in the soft, silken
folds of his begrimed white shirt. How could
she know that that embrace was firm with love?
How could she know what the wild, irregular
beatings of that strong heart were saying? How
could she know that the prolonged hesitancy was
caused by the recrudescence of hopeless longings!
She sensed his effort at calmness, felt an arm uplifted,
a slight concussion, and knew that Eagle
was dead. She did not watch Henry West as he
removed the saddle and bridle from the dead
horse, nor did she see the last tender caress given
to the stiffening neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Had it not been for you, my Eagle&#8212;she&#8212;she&#8212;would&#8212;now&#8212;be&#8212;,&#8221;
were the parting
words given to the favorite of all the horses which
West had ever ridden. And yet he was glad of
the sacrifice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mind staying here alone, Bess, while
I go in search of Mauchacho? It will soon be
growing chilly and dark and we must get home
tonight. Can you give me any idea where he is?&#8221;
Bess looked helplessly about and was still utterly
confused by the mad, mad rush ahead of the
steers. She could not tell if she had ridden one
mile or twenty. West noted her bewilderment,
and with an assurance that he would try to return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
soon started rather doubtingly forward. He
retraced the way they had so recently come and
after several indecisive swervings to the right
and left Bess saw him hit upon a trail and hurry
swiftly on until the thorns and brush hid him
from her view.</p>

<p>How utterly alone she felt! She could scarcely
refrain from running after West and calling
on him to wait! Glancing over her shoulder her
heart was filled with pity and regret at the sight
of the dead hero. Already she saw circling high
in the evening sky, a pair of huge, black wings
eager for prey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll stay here and watch Eagle! Those vultures
shall not banquet yet awhile!&#8221;</p>

<p>Glowing red and yellow colors dyed the evening
skies. Soft shades of purple touched the distant
tops and slopes of the mountains. Darkening
shadows silently gathered among the pines,
indistinct in the distance. Night was coming on
apace, and still the girl stood&#8212;silent and alone,
keeping vigil over the coveted feast. In the glow
of the western sky gleamed brightly the tender
sickle of the new moon. Turning so as to glance
over her shoulder, Bess wished that the waiting
might soon be ended.</p>

<p>She arose from the flat rock upon which she
had been resting and began pacing nervously
back and forth. Snatches of verses she said
aloud, then some strain of a song floated spasmodically
across the range, too wide to send back
an echo. The moon, with its brief consolation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
had gone behind the horizon, and the night was
rapidly growing darker. A qualm of fear filled
the girl&#8217;s heart, as a coyote&#8217;s shrill, hungry cry
rent the air. She quickly drew forth the weapon
which she had always worn, from its snug and inconspicuous
pocket, and stood ready to defend
rather than for defense.</p>

<p>From out the gloom she felt rather than heard
an approach, which she prayed might be Henry
West. A low whistle came in response to her
call, and soon Mauchacho was led to his mistress
and his soft nose brushed caressingly against her
arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had a hard time in finding the saddle or
else I might have returned sooner. Have you
been very anxious and lonely?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can we hurry away from here, Henry. I
cannot bear to feel these dreadful, hungry creatures
so near,&#8221; replied Bess, as another unearthly
cry came from the waiting, anxious coyotes.</p>

<p>West placed Bess in the saddle, flung his own
empty one upon the horse and walked swiftly forward
leading the way. At length they came to a
ranch where West secured a horse, and rode
with conservative speed toward home.</p>

<p>It was after numerous futile calls that at last
they heard the squeak of the ferry-boat as it came
laboriously across the stream in the darkness to
meet them. Dark clouds were filling the sky and
another rain seemed imminent. Groping his way
with the horses, West led them on to the boat and
then lifted Bess from the saddle. Silently they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
stood as the Indian rowed them over the dark
water. Startled by a glare of lightning Bess
placed her arm through Henry West&#8217;s and gave
it a pressure of confidence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Had it not been for the gleam of the beads
showing me your belt I doubt if I could have
lifted you, Bess&#8212;for our&#8212;our ride&#8212;today,&#8221; said
Henry, after a long silence. &#8220;Where did you get
it? I do not remember ever seeing you wear it
before!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have only had it today. An Indian woman
gave it to me this morning as I came over on this
ferry, because&#8212;well, because I held her little
dirty baby in my arms!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bess, that same Indian woman was the one
who directed me when I discovered Mauchacho&#8217;s
shoe print in the trail leading away from the
right direction. She also told me with tears in
her eyes why she gave you her belt. Not wishing
to alarm James, I did not even show him where
you and Mauchacho had gone, giving him some
excuse. I borrowed his spurs, for I knew, intuitively
perhaps, that Eagle&#8212;even Eagle&#8212;might
need them, for the first time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And for the last time, also,&#8221; added Bess, and
tears again came freely.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br />
<span class="medium">THE CAMPING TRIP AND &#8220;PETER PAN&#8221;</span></h2>


<p>It was several days after Bess&#8217; thrilling adventure
before her nerves were again calm and
steady and before her muscles had recovered
from their soreness. While she felt reluctant to
lie in bed, and was sorry because of the extra
worry and work which she caused, still it was
delicious to experience a mother&#8217;s solicitude. No
word of reproof had Mrs. West given her, only
kindness, attention and anxiety. Bess secretly
wished that some one would administer to her
the censure which she felt she richly deserved.
And yet, how it smarted when it came one morning,
just before James and Henry West were
about to start on the fall round-up.</p>

<p>They had come into Bess&#8217; sunlit room to say
good-bye. Her soft, white hand was enclosed for
a moment firmly in West&#8217;s hard and sunburned
palm. He did not dare speak lest the tremor in
his voice should betray him to both sister and
brother. As James bent over his sister, with a
kiss, he said, &#8220;Remember Bess, no more foolish
escapades&#8212;,&#8221; but a firm grasp on his arm
checked the words and led him from the room before
he could see the welling, nervous tears fill
her brown eyes&#8212;and then splash on her tightly
folded hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use, Jim old boy&#8212;she has had
all she can bear already!&#8221; she heard the quarter-breed
say as they went away.</p>

<p>James turned and quickly re-entered his sister&#8217;s
room. Taking her in his arms he kissed
away her tears and left her consoled and happy
once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry and be yourself again, Bess, for the
camping trip next week. I only wish the round-up
were over so that Henry and I might go, too.
We&#8217;ll see you and the Kalispell friends in camp
as we go over by the Big Arm. Guess we can
find the place. So long&#8212;sister&#8212;&#8221; and throwing
her a kiss from the door he hurried to join West,
who was already in the saddle and anxious to be
off.</p>

<p>Bess had been looking forward to the novelty
of camp life ever since the invitation had come to
her from Mrs. West&#8217;s friends at Kalispell. She
was to meet them on the fifth of September on the
south side of the Big Arm of the Lake, directly
opposite Wild Horse Island. Here they were to
camp and hunt small game and fish for ten days.</p>

<p>Bess arose with the sun on the morning of the
fifth, and was soon ready to start for camp, accompanied
by one of the ranch-men whom Mrs.
West had ordered to ride with the girl and pack
her baggage.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you were going too, little Mother,&#8221;
said Bess earnestly as she hurried about, finishing
her preparations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;It would be enjoyable I&#8217;m sure, but I cannot
think of it this time, dear. Come home strong
and safe, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>What a magnificent morning! Just a hint of
autumn in the bracing air, while a soft, hazy
atmosphere veiled the mountains and nestled on
the ripples of the lake. The sun had not yet
mounted high enough to dry the dew which lay
on the grass and dampened the trail. Fifteen
miles toward the north-west was the place where
camp was to be made, the man had told Bess in
response to her question, how far would they
ride?</p>

<p>As they crossed the ferry, all the events of the
recent tragedy surged over her, and as her hand
clasped the beaded belt it sought the place where
the iron hold had broken the threads and loosened
the beads. An unknown and foreign sensation
seemed to sweep over her; a sharp pain, incomprehensible,
clutched her heart as she again
felt the embrace of her rescuer. He stood out
clear, full and bold before her mind&#8217;s eye in a
strange new light! The thought of another man
forced itself into her mind, and she was startled
from her musings as the ferry touched the shore
by a well known voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning; this is a most unexpected
pleasure! You seemed deeply absorbed as I
watched you coming across. I hope you were
thinking of me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was, Mr. Davis&#8212;just then,&#8221; answered Bess
as she accepted the outstretched hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I had intended to call at the <em>HW</em> Ranch this
morning in the hope of seeing you, and here I
find you evidently going on a visit.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cowboy who was accompanying Bess led
the horses off the ferry and down the rocky beach
for water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bess&#8212;dear&#8212;it seems ages since I have seen
you. Why have I not had a line from you? Can&#8217;t
you know that I am eating my heart out because
of your coldness!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, Mr. Davis&#8212;I have not been very
well&#8212;and could not gather enough energy to
write. Wait until I return from my camping
trip and I&#8217;ll write and tell you all about it,&#8221; answered
Bess as she turned to leave, seeing that
the horses had drank their fill and were waiting
for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay a moment! Where are you going?
May I go with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you were not invited,&#8221; she answered,
laughingly. &#8220;Why, you see I am to be in camp
ten days with some friends from Kalispell who
are coming down for the fall birds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes&#8212;I sent a permit to Mr. George and
party to hunt on the reserve, and I also received
an invitation to visit camp. Now that you are to
be there too, may I not hope for a second invitation
from you, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice took that fascinating tone which always
sent an undefinable thrill through her, and
his eyes held her own in a long, steady look.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8212;camp on the Big Arm&#8212;perhaps&#8212;you
can find it,&#8221; came from her lips with an effort.</p>

<p>Davis felt hurt that his request was not answered
more heartily, but he concealed his chagrin
with a smile of assurance that he would
come.</p>

<p>The happy, alert girl saw a subtle change
stealing over nature and knew that autumn had
come.</p>

<p>How delicious was the aroma of the firs and
pines as the horses went along the shaded road
through the long stretch of timber! Occasionally
through the tangle of scrub-maples, whose bright
green foliage was splashed here and there by a
scarlet leaf, one caught a glimpse of the deep
blue, glistening lake and the mountains on its
east shore. Tiny squirrels and chipmunks were
scampering over fallen logs or chattering high up
in the tamarack branches. Every rock and
stump was beautiful with its creeping wreath of
kinnikinick, whose glossy foliage and large scarlet
berries puts to shame the holly. On the buck-brush
hung great, white snow-drops, while the
wild rose bushes were heavy with scarlet fruit.</p>

<p>The whirr of a pheasant through the underbrush
caused Mauchacho to prick up his ears and
quicken his pace. A blue grouse with her late
brood scurried across the road seeking the shelter
of the thicket. Bess wished she too were some
dainty feathered creature, happy in the solitude
of the woods, free from all restraint, secure within
the sheltering arms of the earth. Oh! to creep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
away off under the tender green branches; to
clasp her arms about the rough bark of the pine
trees; to rest her cheek upon the redolent grasses!
On the outstretched limb of a charred pine
tree sat a large, blinking owl. Great tufts of grey
feathers covered his legs and claws, while at his
throat shone the purest white.</p>

<p>Bess raised an imaginary gun with a deliberate
aim, and immediately Mr. Owl stretched his
large white and grey wings and was out of sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, see!&#8221; cried the girl, as only a few yards
ahead of them there sprang across the trail a
white-tailed doe and fawn! Only for a brief instant
did they pause, then went crashing through
the timber and brush, flirting defiant good-byes
with their white flags. The cowboy was watching
surreptitiously from the corner of his eye the
pleasure and animation which Bess was enjoying.
Her brown eyes danced and filled; her
cheeks flamed as if touched with an Indian&#8217;s
paintbrush, suggesting an autumn leaf through
her brown, fluffy hair. Her enjoyment was keen
because of a sweet and sensitive temperament
alive to the surroundings and susceptible to the
wonders of nature.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you hear that?&#8221; asked Bess of her companion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8212;that was the boat whistle. Your party
are probably near their landing place. Guess we
have about three miles more to go before we
reach there.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a short time they again came into full view
of the great, blue lake. How immense it was!
The Great Arm alone was a lake. To the right
lay Wild Horse Island; the camping ground must
be very near. Had it not been for the sound of
voices or the driving of tent-stakes the camp
would have been hard to locate, so snugly was it
concealed among the trees and by a thicket of
cottonwoods and small pines.</p>

<p>It was a busy scene which Bess saw as she
rode into camp. Already the tents were being
pitched; boxes and bundles and guns were being
carried from the beach; beautiful setters were
sniffing at every leaf and twig; while over near
the branches of an overhanging cedar, Joe, the
colored cook, with white cap, coat and apron
deftly donned had already lighted a fire preparatory
for the first meal. Cheery greetings of welcome
were exchanged as Bess slid from her
saddle and each one of the girls seemed bent upon
talking loudest and longest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! girls&#8212;girls&#8212;save a little breath or else
you won&#8217;t have enough to last ten days!&#8221; called
Mrs. Bland, with the authority of a chaperon, but
her voice was not heard above the laughing and
chattering of the other three. Such a time pumping
up the air-beds, shaking blankets, unpacking
satchels, arranging rugs and adjusting the other
things in the ladies&#8217; boudoir!</p>

<p>&#8220;Little Honey&#8221; (as Mrs. Bland&#8217;s little daughter
had been nicknamed) was too engrossed trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
to attire herself in new, blue overalls and a
boy&#8217;s &#8220;really&#8221; shirt, to be interested in her surroundings.
Tucking her braids under a big,
straw hat, then thrusting her tiny fists deep into
the spacious pockets, she cried gleefully,&#8212;&#8220;Well,
Mother&#8212;Here&#8217;s Peter Pan.&#8221; Undaunted by the
teasings and laughter of the other girls &#8220;Peter
Pan&#8221; strode out of the tent to show herself to
the &#8220;other boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you dogs! Charge! Lady! Jack
Down! Charge, Gladstone! Didn&#8217;t you dogs
ever see a boy before!&#8221; she cried amid frantic efforts
to ward off the playful, eager animals. Just
then she heard the rattle of wheels and ran to
meet Mr. George who had driven down from Kalispell
so that the horses and light wagon could be
used in going to the good hunting fields each day.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m &#8216;Peter Pan,&#8217; and these pockets are so
handy, and it is so much easier to climb that I
guess I&#8217;ll just stay a boy,&#8221; she announced as she
clambered into the seat beside Mr. George and
reached for the reins.</p>

<p>Such a hungry, hearty &#8220;bunch&#8221; as sat down
to dinner! How the aroma of the forest and the
sweet, pine laden air whetted their appetites!
&#8220;Peter Pan&#8221; could not get enough bread with its
thick layer of apple-sauce. Joe, the cook, looked
on with trepidation and wondered how long the
larder would supply the demand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, Joe; don&#8217;t look so worried, we&#8217;ll
have birds for supper,&#8221; said one of the men, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
arose from the table and began filling his hunting
vest with shells. The snap of the barrel of a shotgun
brought all three dogs up with a bound, so
eager were they to feel the feathers of a retrieve.
At sundown, when the tired men and still more
weary dogs came dragging themselves back into
camp, each bore evidence of his spoils. Through
the carriers were hung the limp-stretched necks
of a covey, while the several feathers still sticking
to the dogs&#8217; jaws, proved how faithfully and
well they had done their work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come with me Miss&#8212;Miss Flet&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just call me Bess, it&#8217;s easier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Bess, if you will come with me we&#8217;ll
give the dogs their supper,&#8221; said &#8220;Peter Pan,&#8221; as
she led the way to where the dog biscuits had
been placed. The dogs were all seated on their
haunches waiting with hungry stomachs for their
meal.</p>

<p>&#8220;These are dreadfully hard things to feed
you, poor dogs,&#8221; said the tiny girl, as she tried in
vain to break the biscuits. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m not a
dog, aren&#8217;t you, Miss Bess? But then, this kind
of biscuit is good for a dog, &#8217;cause they make him
take aim better. Charge, Jack!&#8221; she cried to the
hungry dog who could not wait for her discourse
to be finished as he took his supper out of her
hand and hurried away to find an undisturbed
place to enjoy it.</p>

<p>It was dark before the birds were ready for
the table, and supper was eaten by the aid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
numerous candles and lanterns. All were weary,
so after the plans for the morrow had been made
and everything made secure in camp for the
night, each sought his couch and slept; some to
dream, perhaps of feasts and plenty, or of ringing
shots and pointing dogs; one to dream of
&#8220;comfy&#8221; trousers and handy pockets; another to
see in her sleep&#8217;s vision, the flaming, dilated nostrils
of a fleeing horse and the dark, determined
face of his relentless rider.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />
<span class="medium">THE TROUT DEAL</span></h2>


<p>As soon as Bess heard the breakfast fire cracking
she crept out of her bed and hurriedly dressed
herself. &#8220;Peter Pan&#8221; begged her softly, so that
the other sleepers might not be disturbed, to
&#8220;Wait a min&#8217;t for me.&#8221; They looked like two
hungry birds as they perched on a log near where
Joe was preparing breakfast. Snug in their red
sweaters and tams they sat with arms entwined
about each other, already fast and true friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever see Mr. George &#8216;flop&#8217; pan-cakes?&#8221;
questioned &#8220;Peter Pan,&#8221; as she saw with
utter satisfaction a creamy mixture being stirred
by the cook. &#8220;No? Well, I&#8217;ll have him give a
free exhibition this morning immediately before
the big performance,&#8221; added the child, with artful
mimicry of the man she had heard at the circus
during the summer.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, he just takes the frying pan like
this&#8212;gives it two or three little wiggles&#8212;then
throws the pan-cake up in the air and makes it
turn a &#8216;somerset&#8217; like the circus performer did,
and then lets it splash back into the pan. Ask
Joe to let us try one before the others come to
breakfast. Shall we?&#8221;</p>

<p>All thoughts of any attempts in the culinary
art were displaced by the soft sound of a moccasined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
foot behind them. &#8220;Peter Pan&#8221; clung
tightly to Bess&#8217; hand as they watched the slow
approach of the old Indian. What a wrinkled,
old visage, hardened by the vicissitudes of years,
attenuated by many fasts. A mat of coarse, grey
hair partially covered eyes that were still keen
and undimmed by the ravages of time. The tattered
blanket illy concealed his quivering form,
while worn and ragged moccasins scarcely protected
his feet from the stones and thorns.</p>

<p>Bess&#8217; heart melted by the picture of abject
want, and with a few, quick signs she asked the
old Indian &#8220;would he eat.&#8221; A grin of acquiescence
was her reply, and soon she had placed before
him such a feast as he had never seen before.
He fell to devouring the food, almost like a
hungry dog, but was checked by a decisive touch
on the shoulder. A look of surprise filled his eyes
as he paused with open mouth ready to receive
the next morsel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shame;&#8221; firmly said the girl; &#8220;Why forget
to thank God?&#8221; and she raised her hand toward
heaven. Slowly the food was replaced upon the
plate; a look of incredulity rested for a moment
upon the seamed, old face; then with eyes turned
toward the crests of the hills all radiant with the
glow of the morning, a withered, dirty hand reverently
made the sign of the cross. When his
hunger was appeased he bestowed upon his benefactor
a look of thanks.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;You go catch fish. Bring nice trout here.
More muck-a-muck tonight,&#8221; instructed Bess with
numerous gestures.</p>

<p>The old Indian nodded that he understood
and then explained his futile attempt to catch
fish the day before. No word did he speak. He
waved his hand slowly toward the direction of
the North shore of the Big Arm, showed how he
had cast the line again and again, but had caught
no fish; how he had fished unceasingly all the
while the sun arose from its eastern horizon to
the zenith and until it had descended to rest behind
the hills; how he had returned to his teepee
with his willow switch empty and had gone hungry
to sleep. Now it was again day! He motioned
that he would walk far along the lake&#8217;s
opposite shore where the rocks jutted into the
water&#8212;there&#8212;could she see? Pointing to some
beef which was hung up in the tree he made Bess
understand that with the aid of that for bait he
could catch the wily trout as fast as he could
cast the hook, and that soon his basket of willows
and leaves would be full. Soon he was sent on
his way rejoicing,&#8212;happy because his stomach&#8217;s
craving had ceased, glad because of the hope of
another meal.</p>

<p>The tardy members of the party had at last
come to breakfast. Mr. George was prevailed
upon to &#8220;flop&#8221; the pan-cakes, and &#8220;Peter Pan&#8217;s&#8221;
number increased alarmingly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;I eat so many because it is such fun to
watch them perform, not because I like them,&#8221;
she assured her mother, as she watched the marvelous
feat repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name will now have to be &#8216;Peter Pan-cake,&#8217;
&#8217;cause I&#8217;m so full,&#8221; she said, as she gathered
up the remaining few and fed them to the
waiting dogs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Bess&#8212;come see Gladstone!&#8221; she cried
gleefully, as she watched the dog dig a nice little
hole in the leaves and then bury his breakfast.
How artfully he scraped the twigs and dirt together
in long sweeps with his nose, and then
pressed it down firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; she explained, &#8220;he does it that way
so that the other dogs can&#8217;t find it. Then when
he gets hungry he goes and digs up his&#8212;his&#8212;why,
his money, and eats it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Money,&#8221; laughed Bess, heartily. &#8220;I know&#8212;you
mean <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cache</i>, don&#8217;t you, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes! Mr. George, an&#8217; he knows everything
about dogs, told me what it was, and I
couldn&#8217;t quite remember, you see. Once he told
me all about Jack&#8217;s grandmothers and grandfathers
and uncles and all the family, and he
called it a legacy or something like that. Don&#8217;t
you think it would be grand to know so much
about dogs?&#8221; chatted the tiny girl to her interested
listener.</p>

<p>Soon everything was ready to start for the
day&#8217;s hunt; lunch basket filled, guns and ammunition
ready, dogs eager to be off, and a wagon
filled with hearty, happy people. They would try<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the stubble of the wheat fields on the Baptiste
ranch today, and all felt confident already of
much sport and many birds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Honk&#8212;honk&#8212;honk&#8221; greeted their ears before
many miles had passed behind them. Such
scrambling for guns! Such hurrying to get a
good position! Such banging of shells! &#8220;Honk&#8212;honk&#8221;&#8212;and
the geese went sailing on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess the weather isn&#8217;t right for a goose,&#8221;
ventured &#8220;Peter Pan,&#8221; the only one who felt disposed
to make any explanation.</p>

<p>But the weather proved just right for chickens!
And the hunters desisted because they were
ashamed to slaughter more.</p>

<p>Bess found the Indian squatted at a comfortable
distance from the &#8220;kitchen fire&#8221; waiting her,
upon her return. While the others were busy
with the birds, or the horses, or supper preparations,
she closed her deal for the fish. Spread out
upon the large, green thimble-berry leaves were
several beautiful speckled and salmon-tinted
trout, all large and firm. The old Indian motioned
that she was to have them all and that he
would keep those left in the basket. Bess peeped
inquisitively into the nest of leaves and there beheld&#8212;oh!
such beauties! Shiny brook trout!
They should be the feast. She showed with convincing
gestures her unfeigned contempt for
large fish when the lovely small ones were to be
had. Yes, he might return these to the basket
and leave the small ones for her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>At first the grizzled old man looked at her as
if he were deeply puzzled. Did she really mean
that she preferred the small fish! A queer, hesitating
smile slowly began to spread over his face
as he reluctantly drew out the fish, one by one,
and placed them on the leaves. Several times he
paused, and by numerous frantic gestures and
gutteral sounds asked again if she really wished
him to replace the larger fish.</p>

<p>At last, so completely was he assured, he
quickly flung the remaining beauties into the basket,
snatched the parcel of food which the cook
had prepared for him and arose to hasten away.
Again he was checked by a touch on the arm and
with his hand half raised again to make the sign
of thanks, his astonishment was even greater increased
by a proffered half-dollar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trout for breakfast!&#8221; Bess called cheerfully
to the &#8220;colored gentleman&#8221; whose white teeth
gleamed through a whimsical smile. &#8220;Trout for
breakfast!&#8221; she again announced to the men of
the party who had been watching the fish deal
with unobserved interest, and by this time were
convulsed with laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come here girls&#8212;come &#8216;Mr. Peter Pan&#8217; and
see the shining beauties!&#8221; she added, as they
came from the tent with hastily arranged toilets.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad you are all so tickled to death
over our prospective breakfast,&#8221; she continued,
while the laughter increased,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span> &#8220;but I must say the
joke&#8212;if there be one&#8212;seems rather jejune.&#8221;
Little &#8220;Peter Pan&#8221; squeezed five little sympathetic
fingers into the tightly closed palm of the
perplexed girl, led her with gentle determination
behind a clump of scrub-pines, drew her fluffy
head down to her lips and whispered softly: &#8220;I
heard Mr. George whisper to Uncle Jim that they
were &#8216;squaw-fish,&#8217; but if I can I&#8217;ll try to help you
eat them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bess gathered the child into a loving embrace
and together they went to supper to face the jolly
ridicule.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the sorriest of all,&#8221; chimed in &#8220;Peter
Pan,&#8221; &#8220;&#8217;cause there&#8217;s only one thing that&#8217;s better
than trout.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what is that other?&#8221; questioned Bess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s doughnuts with the holes fried
shut.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some fairy must have brought some for breakfast
next morning, for there they were, round, fat
and golden, with only little puckers where the
holes used to be. A tell-tale patch of flour on
Bess&#8217; cheek gave away the secret of the early
riser.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<span class="medium">A PSEUDO SQUAW</span></h2>


<p>The &#8220;girls&#8221; were to remain in camp, while Mr.
George and &#8220;Uncle Jim&#8221; drove the horses to a
ranch to have them re-shod. A trip to Sullivan
Creek had been planned, and it was necessary
that the team and wagon be in good condition to
cover the long distance over a rough, hilly road.
The dogs were in need of a rest to recuperate for
the next chase. The good-byes were called and
re-answered till the men were out of sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! let&#8217;s gather these red thorn-apples and
buck-brush berries and make bracelets and
strings of beads, and then dress up in blankets
and play we are squaws,&#8221; suggested &#8220;Peter Pan,&#8221;
as she began to fill her many pockets with the
berries within her reach. Each one seemed bent
on plucking the most and soon hats were brimming
over.</p>

<p>They sat in a bright, sunny exposure near the
edge of the water and strung the red and white
berries on long, stout threads, the while happy
jokes were made, stories told or snatches of
familiar songs were sung. As Bess began to sing
again one of the familiar verses, &#8220;Peter Pan&#8221;
checked her rather unceremoniously with,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span> &#8220;Oh!
please&#8212;Miss Bess, we have <em>sang</em> that so many
times already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dearie, you mean to say&#8212;have&#8212;what?&#8221;
corrected her mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell, mother&#8212;I&#8217;m not that far yet in
my book,&#8221; came the ever ready answer of the little
grammarian.</p>

<p>Bess had quietly slipped away while the others
were still industriously threading their beads.
Presently the three dogs, who were stretched out
in the glorious warmth of the sunshine near the
busy workers, suddenly came to their feet with
a bound and ran barking savagely at a form approaching
through the trees. As suddenly did
they drop their tails between their legs and
fawned at the feet of the blanketed intruder, as a
familiar voice said softly yet commandingly,
&#8220;Boys! Gladstone! Jack! What&#8217;s the fuss?
Don&#8217;t you know me?&#8221;</p>

<p>They could scarcely be blamed for their mistake,
for Bess looked a veritable Indian. About
her was a vivid blanket, a red cloth wound her
forehead nearly concealing her hair which had
been braided and hung down either side of her
neck. A pair of moccasins (which Mrs. West
had urged her to bring in case the nights might
prove cold) and the coils of red and white beads
completed her costume.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look just like a really Indian girl,&#8221;
cried &#8220;Peter Pan,&#8221; clapping her hands gleefully.
&#8220;Why, even the dogs thought you were one too,
didn&#8217;t they?&#8221; she added, with her deep blue eyes
glowing with appreciation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Here Bess, go down by the road and get us
a few more of the thorn-apples; my string is not
yet long enough,&#8221; said Mrs. Bland, as she and the
others kept on with their task.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there are some splendid large ones!&#8221; said
Bess to herself, as she caught sight of a clump of
the brush, with shiny, red fruit a little way down
the road. She wandered aimlessly on, watching
the dust puff out as she made &#8220;toed-in&#8221; tracks
with the moccasins. The choice place for thorn-apples
had been passed, but then, that did not
matter, as here were more directly ahead of her.</p>

<p>The sound of approaching horses and their
riders&#8217; voices came to her ears. The delay of indecision,
whether to flee to camp, or whether to
conceal herself in the near-by thicket, made either
impossible, for already directly in front of her
came two horsemen, and she knew that she had
been seen. Turning her back toward the approach,
and concealing her face in a fold of the
blanket, she stood aside, hoping that they might
pass without giving her any especial attention.</p>

<p>One had passed, and peeping from her cover
she saw that he wore the Indian police uniform.
A soft chuckle reached her ear, and she knew
that he knew he saw a masquerader. But her
heart stood still, as a voice so familiar, yet just
now so foreign said, &#8220;You ride on ahead and see
if you can locate their camp. I&#8217;ll be there presently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>She heard the horse stop and felt his nose
brush her blanket, so near had he come to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>Klah-on-ya-Mary</em>&#8212;are you here alone?&#8221; and
the end of a quirt touched her none too gently on
the head. She heard a stirrup squeak and felt
that the man was dismounting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come here&#8212;I want to talk to you. You
know me&#8212;I am the Agent&#8212;I want to look at
you;&#8221; but the instant the silent figure felt the
touch of his eager fingers upon her arm, Bess
sprang forward like a frightened deer, and ran
swiftly into the bushes and was soon out of sight.
It was all the man could do to restrain the frightened
horse, and when he again looked to where he
had seen the bushes part to enfold a brightly-hued
fleeing creature, they had folded their
branches as meekly as if they had nothing to conceal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Damn these squaws; they are not usually so
touchy,&#8221; said the man, as he gave his horse an
unnecessary jerk at the reins as he remounted
and started on. A thin, blue, curling smoke
through the trees revealed to him the campers&#8217;
location, while awaiting him at the trail was his
escort. The police continued on his journey upon
receiving a few minute instructions, and the
Agent reined his horse into the path leading to
the camp. At first he saw no one except the
white-aproned man busy preparing lunch, then
his advent was seen by the ladies, still busy with
their beads.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bland came forward to receive the visitor.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am very much pleased to meet you, Mr.
Davis,&#8221; she said, as he introduced himself. &#8220;I
am sorry that the men are away from camp just
at present. They are to be back in time for
luncheon. Won&#8217;t you dismount and help us enjoy
a few of the birds which you so kindly permitted
us to kill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you&#8212;I am sure it will be a treat,&#8221; he
answered as he slid from the saddle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Er&#8212;I&#8212;I had hoped to meet Miss Fletcher
here also,&#8221; he added, as he hesitatingly glanced
about.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, she is here&#8212;that is, she will be here
presently. She just now went down to the road
after some more thorn-apples for our chains. We
are going to play Indian,&#8221; she laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even the dogs thought Miss Bess was a really
squaw when they saw her all wrapped in a
blanket,&#8221; put in &#8220;Peter Pan&#8221; as she came inquisitively
forward to see their visitor.</p>

<p>Slowly the explanation of the squaw by the
road-side forced itself into his brain. For a moment
he held his breath wondering if he had
made a fool of himself. Perhaps she did not recognize
him, but if she did he would easily convince
her it was a joke&#8212;that he had known it
was she all the while.</p>

<p>What could be keeping Bess so long? Why
did she not return to camp with the gathered
thorn-apples? Each moment a glance went up
the trail, hoping that she would soon be coming.
No one saw the silent pseudo squaw as she crept
softly on her hands and knees in the shadow of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the logs and the close covering of the brush. No
one saw her now as she lay flat on the ground securely
concealed by the thick leaves and the tall
grasses, watching the occupants of the camp with
glowing eyes. No one? Yes, one alert pair of
ears had heard a twig snap; one keen nose had
sniffed the air, and now a pair of appealing eyes
were looking into hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Charge Gladdy!&#8221; she said to the dog with a
wriggling tail, as emphatically as she could in a
whisper. Then she flung her arm about him
holding him close lest he betray her concealment.
Would the visitor never go? Should she be compelled
finally to come forth and rejoin the others
at the camp? If she could only convince herself
that the Agent had recognized her in the road
and had not really thought she was a squaw she
would not now hesitate in meeting him. But
somehow a feeling of uncertainty crept into her
heart and for the moment made her fairly hate
him. The approach of horses along the highway
caused her to sit upright and listen. Gladstone,
too, heard the sound and before he could be
checked, began a vigorous barking. She could
hear the horses coming through the tangled
brush, and in a moment more she stood face to
face with James Fletcher and Henry West.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great guns! Bess; you are a regular Pocahontas!
How&#8217;s that for a &#8216;peachy&#8217; squaw?&#8221; he
said to West, as he nearly tumbled from his saddle
and gave his sister a vigorous hug. Henry
West had also dismounted and caught his hors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>e&#8217;s
bridle over his arm. In his glance was a look of
questioning approval which caused Bess to ask:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am wondering, Henry, if you like me this
way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If all squaws looked as well, a man wouldn&#8217;t
mind being an Indian,&#8221; he said significantly,
walking by her side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! here you are; where did you hide?&#8221;
cried little &#8220;Peter Pan,&#8221; as she ran forward to
meet her favorite.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put &#8216;Peter Pan&#8217; on the horse and let her
ride,&#8221; said Bess, in the way of an introduction
to Henry West. He lifted the child gently and
placed her in the saddle, carefully guarding her
lest she fall. The child was watching the dark
features of her companion with an apprehensive
look. As he held her for a moment in his arms
when she dismounted, she softly touched the
bronze cheek with her fingers, and said: &#8220;I like
you, even if you are&#8212;so much darker&#8212;than my
Uncle Jim,&#8221; and slid, half afraid, out of his clasp
and ran to her mother&#8217;s side, her eyes following
him.</p>

<p>As soon as Mr. Davis found an opportunity
amid all the confusion of introductions and
greeting and clamorous talk, he stood near Bess
and said: &#8220;Really, I had begun to think you had
fled to your &#8216;wick-i-up&#8217; and were not coming to
see me at all. Your disguise was scarcely sufficient,
for I knew you instantly and tried to carry
out your joke, but you were too hasty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bess suddenly let the blanket fall from her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
shoulders to the ground and faced Mr. Davis
squarely. She looked into his eyes searchingly;
beyond them she gazed till her accusing glance
penetrated his very soul. Without the tremor of
an eyelash her search was answered by a look as
steady and firm as her own. At last a smile
broke upon her lips as she said: &#8220;I did&#8212;did
half imagine that you really thought&#8212;you were
talking to an Indian.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are too uninteresting to me even to
stop to speak to,&#8221; he reassured her, and was glad
that further explanation was interrupted by the
arrival of Mr. George and &#8220;Uncle Jim.&#8221;</p>

<p>Soon all were enjoying the delicious birds,
done to a turn by the efficient chef. Perhaps no
one of the merry company, except Bess, noticed
the reticence of Henry West, who sat beside her.
She quietly gave his hand a little squeeze as she
passed him the salt, which sent the blood pounding
through his heart till he felt it could surely
be heard by the others.</p>

<p>In spite of the many earnest requests to remain,
James and Henry declared that they must
hurry on to rejoin the rest of the bunch who were
on the round-up. Dave Davis, the Indian agent,
also took his departure after several futile attempts
to speak with Bess alone.</p>

<p>The rest of the day was busy with cleaning
guns, greasing the wheels and loading the wagon,
preparatory for the long trip to Sullivan Creek
on the morrow, which would in all probability
take two or three days.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a><br />
<span class="medium">AN UNUSUAL PROPOSAL</span></h2>


<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry this is our last day in camp, aren&#8217;t
you, &#8216;Peter Pan&#8217;? We have had such a splendid
time and it seems all too short.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bess and &#8220;Peter Pan,&#8221; together with one of
the dogs, were left alone in camp while the rest
of the party had gone on their last shoot. The
little girl was feeling slightly indisposed after
the last few strenuous days, so Bess asked to be
permitted to stay &#8220;at home&#8221; with her for the
day, as she could not, or rather would not, shoot
the chickens; anyway, Mrs. Bland, too, might
enjoy one more day with her gun and the birds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am just dreadfully sorry that we shall
have to go home, &#8217;cause then I won&#8217;t see you any
more, and I feel as if I love you next to my
mother,&#8221; answered &#8220;Peter Pan,&#8221; and she put up
a pair of puckered lips for a kiss as she hastily
swallowed the last bit of her apple pie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really&#8212;Miss Bess, do you&#8212;do you think
that a little girl ought to have only one piece of
pie?&#8221; she asked, so entreatingly that Bess, injudiciously,
she feared, gave her another large,
juicy triangle.</p>

<p>Laughingly she said: &#8220;There are times, dear,
and this is one of them, when I think a little
girl may have all the pie she wants.&#8221; But before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the last crumb had been safely stored away, black
lashes were drooping languidly over a pair of
deep blue eyes, and a sleepy little girl was carried
into the tent where she might sleep and
dream of apple pies&#8212;p-i-e-s.</p>

<p>Bess sat beside the sleeper with an unopened
magazine on her knee.</p>

<p>Just then her eyes rested on one of the air-beds,
and immediately she began to wonder why
it shouldn&#8217;t make a good boat. The more she
thought of it the more she determined to try it
and see.</p>

<p>Without much trouble she arrayed herself in
an improvised bathing suit and removed the
canvas cover from the inflated rubber bed. She
felt a reluctance in leaving &#8220;Peter Pan&#8221; alone,
but she thought she would be gone only a few
moments and would be in full view of the tent all
the time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, Lady!&#8221; Calling to the drowsy dog,
she placed the animal with the sleeping child.</p>

<p>Lifting the bed upon her back and shoulders
she proceeded to the beach, after procuring two
of the granite plates for paddles. Far down near
the water&#8217;s edge she could see Joe busy dressing
birds for dinner. She soon had her craft safely
launched and was paddling about with great
glee. Its motion was susceptible to the slightest
stroke of the paddles, and try as she would she
could not make it tip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s such fun! I wish little &#8216;Peter Pan&#8217;
were here, too, to enjoy it,&#8221; she said aloud as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
circled and splashed about in the water. Now
she would sit on one corner and dangle her feet
in the water, now slide completely in while clinging
firmly to the float.</p>

<p>An unceremonious barking from the tent
caused her to scramble quickly onto the bobbing
craft and look to see what or who might be the
intruder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodness!&#8221; she exclaimed, as she saw Dave
Davis leap from his horse and fasten the reins
about a tree. He was just about to proceed toward
the tent when she called loudly to him, that
he might not awake the sleeping child. At first
he did not locate the direction of the call, then
soon discovered the voyager and her ship.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ship ahoy!&#8221; he called, as he made hurried
strides over the round pebbles and larger stones
on the beach.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am proxene in camp today; but I must
confess no visitors were expected,&#8221; said Bess,
slipping into the water to cover her confusion, as
she remembered too late her dishabille.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you to be next, I wonder! One
day I find a squaw and another a mermaid!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on in&#8212;the water&#8217;s fine,&#8221; said Bess,
making foaming eddies.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s rather dangerous&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; interrupted the girl. &#8220;See, she
can&#8217;t tip,&#8221; as she tried to convince him by her
varied maneuvers.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Be serious a moment, Bess, and come out; I
have something very important to tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I can&#8217;t come out with this rig on.
Really, I can&#8217;t,&#8221; answered the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am in a hurry, but must talk with you
while we are alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then tell me here. I can hear it&#8212;anything&#8212;begin,&#8221;
humorously replied Bess, splashing
vigorously.</p>

<p>He deliberately stepped upon a large boulder
which projected out of the water not far from the
air-bed boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bess,&#8221; he began seriously; and then added
slowly as he held her eyes firmly with his own,
&#8220;you and I are to be married next month&#8212;the
fifteenth!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wh&#8212;,&#8221; came in a gasp to the girl&#8217;s parted
lips; but no further sound could she utter. For
a full moment she stared at the man standing so
resolutely, as if he were a part of the very rock
itself, his large, splendid form drawn to its full
height, till he seemed like a giant towering above
her. His eyes were intense with passion, and his
voice trembled with emotion when he again repeated:
&#8220;We are to be married in a month, dear.
I am going away from this place, and you are
going with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The astonished girl gave a nervous gasp as
she cleared her throat, trying to make her words
audible.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not seem to&#8212;to understand! I&#8212;am&#8212;to&#8212;go&#8212;away&#8212;go&#8212;with
you?&#8221; she asked, as her
face grew pale and her lips became almost blue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dear&#8212;as my wife&#8212;I cannot go without
you&#8212;I could not live without you now!&#8221;</p>

<p>Stooping down he caught hold of the floating
&#8220;boat,&#8221; which had drifted quite against the rock
upon which he stood. Stretching forth the other
hand he caught the girl by the arm and lifted
her upon the rock close beside himself. The
water from her soaked garments trickled down
as he held her in a tight embrace. At length he
ceased to blind and to smother her with ardent
kisses, and whispered, &#8220;Tell me yes&#8212;yes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m&#8212;cold! Please go.&#8221; Her quivering
form and blue lips accentuated her words.</p>

<p>&#8220;First say that you love me&#8212;that you do
care.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Care? Oh! yes&#8212;I care! Love?&#8212;I do not
know!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When are you to return to the ranch? Shall
I wait and come then for my reply?&#8221; asked Davis,
earnestly; and Bess, hoping that her answer
might cause him to hasten away, said eagerly:
&#8220;Yes&#8212;do&#8212;tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not resist the parting kiss, but her
lips did not respond to his pressure. She heard
him hurrying over the pebbles, heard him speak
to his horse, knew that he had gone, but still she
stood facing the lake, looking at, yet beyond the
mountains. A feeling of numbness crept over
her body and chilled her soul. A child&#8217;s voice
calling aroused her from her lethargy, and with
a quick bound she sprang forward and ran to
the tent. After all, she had not been gone so very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>long, though it seemed as if an eternity had been
crowded into the half hour.</p>

<p>While she was dressing &#8220;Peter Pan&#8221; had gone
to view the wonderful boat which Bess had told
her of, and soon came hurrying back with the entreaty
to &#8220;let&#8217;s try it again&#8212;please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The water is too cold for you, dearie&#8212;and
besides, I am tired from my long voyage, you
see. Come, we will go down by the water and
wait until the hunters come back, and I&#8217;ll tell
you stories of ships&#8212;and seas&#8212;and everything,
&#8217;neverything else.&#8221;</p>

</div></div>

<p>Sitting side by side with a warm blanket
about them, they watched the sunset. The mountains
were tipped in varying hues of purple and
lavender. Streams of glowing reds and yellows
burned at their bases like huge fairy fires. The
clouds were delicate tints of pink and coral upon
the softer white and grey. The tiny ripples over
the broad expanse of water were an ever-changing
kaleidoscope,&#8212;first a tender, blue sapphire,
then an immense emerald, now an opal with its
evasive colors beautifully blended. Soon the
sun, like a great ball of rusted brass, slid down
behind the mighty hills, leaving but the glowing
embers of a smoldering day. Softly the vermillion
changed into lavender, deepened into purple
and fell into charred umber. All the western
sky was but a blackened, cheerless grate, and another
day vanished into ashes and oblivion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it not beautiful?&#8221; said the little watcher,
as she looked into the soft, brown eyes of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
companion. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you feel glad that you live
here where everything is so beautiful?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dearie&#8212;I want to stay here&#8212;here&#8212;near
the mountains, always!&#8221; And the child
brushed away Bess&#8217; tears, wondering why she
should cry.</p>

<p>Oh! the reluctance with which good-byes were
said the next morning as camp was broken up
and all departed for home. Plans for next year
were already projected and promises half made
to come again. But who could know where all
would be when again the autumn leaf should fall
and the whir of wings should call?</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br />
<span class="medium">WHY A CHEEK BLANCHES</span></h2>


<p>Mrs. West had been watching the road for
nearly an hour, each moment expecting Bess to
come. The man had started after the girl early
in the morning, and she was impatient for their
arrival. At last her anxiety was relieved as she
caught a glimpse of Mauchacho hurrying toward
home. She clasped the girl in a loving embrace
and told her how long the time had been and
how lonely she had felt.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am never going to let you go away again,
my dear; I cannot be happy without you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going&#8212;to&#8212;to&#8212;a&#8212;be married next
month!&#8221; came like a thunderbolt from a clear
sky. Bess slowly continued to draw off her riding
gloves, then to unfasten her sombrero, and
flung them upon the steps where she stood. She
ran her fingers through her hair, pushing it back
from her face, glancing at the same time at the
&#8220;little Mother,&#8221; whose silence became alarming.
The woman&#8217;s face grew white, and her eyes
dimmed by a thin film.</p>

<p>&#8220;Next month&#8212;Mr. Davis&#8212;he will take me
away&#8212;&#8221; continued Bess, disconnectedly. Then
pulling herself together she told Mrs. West of
Mr. Davis&#8217; visit; how he had implored her to end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
his unhappiness; that he could not go away without
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought it all over as I came riding home.
James will not always care to be tied down by
an &#8216;old maid&#8217; sister, as I realize that before very
long he and Berenice Morton will be married;
and while I know that their home would gladly
be shared with me, still I could not forever be
an encumbrance. You&#8212;little Mother&#8212;the only
mother I have ever known&#8212;I would gladly stay
near you&#8212;always. But he needs me, too&#8212;I have
made him care for me, and now can I honestly,
honorably, destroy his happiness, or perhaps his
life?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. West listened closely to the serious declaration,
then lifting the lovely face with both
her hands, she questioned: &#8220;Do you love him,
Bess?&#8221;</p>

<p>For an instant the eyelids quavered, then
with hesitation Bess replied: &#8220;How can I know?
He fills me with a strange excitement. It must
be love! I do not know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my dear&#8212;I pray you may be happy.
He must convince you that you do love him, that
you understand the new and subtle voice in your
heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8212;yes&#8212;&#8221; came from the girl&#8217;s lips in an
abstracted tone, while her soft brown eyes sought
something in far-off space. She did not hear
when Mrs. West again addressed her, and gave
a sudden start as one awakened abruptly from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
slumber when the white-haired woman touched
her tenderly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did not hear what I told you, dear; I
said that I also had a surprise for you. See!
Here it is,&#8221; as she held up a yellow envelope. &#8220;It
is a message from your friend, Miss Morton.
Fearing it contained some very important news,
I took the liberty to read it in case I should need
to send a messenger after you to the camp. It
came two days ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bess read the telegram eagerly. &#8220;Oh, joy!
Then she should reach here tomorrow! I wonder
if I can ever wait so long!&#8221;</p>

<p>How she flew about during the early afternoon
hours, making preparations for her friend&#8217;s
reception! Her dainty room, all fresh and clean,
was at last given the finishing touches, and she
stood back near the doorway with her pretty
head perked on one side, like a saucy wren&#8217;s, and
her hands folded tightly together behind her. A
critical eye scanned every article in the room,
and as it swept the mirror it caught sight of a
very flushed face with a frame of soft, brown
hair that had rebelled at longer being confined
beneath the little white dust cap. An involuntary
laugh escaped from the girl&#8217;s lips as she saw
the disheveled reflection, but almost instantly
her merry countenance changed to an expression
of seriousness, as she suddenly remembered that
she had promised to give Dave Davis his answer
today. Even then she heard some one approach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
and running to the open window she looked
through the curtain to see who the visitor was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! but he is splendid&#8212;I never saw before
how tall and great he really is! How red his
cheeks are today; how brown his eyes are! Oh!
I never noticed before that he had such lovely
hair&#8212;and feet&#8212;and&#8212;&#8221; ran tumultuously
through her mind. She was looking at her lover
through different glasses now, and saw with
other eyes than before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, little Mother,&#8221; she called hastily, in response
to a gentle tap at her door, &#8220;please say
that I shall be down presently.&#8221;</p>

<p>Would her hair never go up properly? Such
thumbs for fingers! Where on earth were her
shoes? Everything else was out of place!</p>

<p>&#8220;I will put on my &#8216;dear&#8217; little dress,&#8221; she
thought, as she drew from its corner her treasure.
Pale yellow crepe, soft, silken, crepy, with
knots and loops of brilliant orange-colored velvet.
In her hair she fastened a tiny golden butterfly,
whose gauzy wings swayed with her every
movement. Tiny golden slippers peeped from
beneath her gown, and amber beads gleamed
through the folds of lace about her throat. How
the gown recalled the only time she had worn it,
one night at a musicale when she had sung Nevin&#8217;s
<cite>Mon Desir</cite>.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that my riding togs feel more comfortable,
after all,&#8221; she thought, as she surveyed
herself once more in the long mirror, before going
into the library.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>Her silken petticoats rustled and swished as
she descended the stairs, as if they fain would
silence the beatings of her heart. She halted for
a moment before the half-open door, nervously
wiping her lips with a dainty handkerchief. Then
she stepped calmly into the room.</p>

<p>Davis arose and started eagerly forward, but
stopped abruptly as he beheld the delightful picture
which she made. Neither spoke for an instant,
as each gazed directly into luminous
brown eyes.</p>

<p>With an effort, as she again brushed the bit
of lace across her lips, Bess spoke: &#8220;I have decided,
Mr. Davis. My answer is&#8212;yes!&#8221;</p>

<p>How long he held her in passionate embrace,
how fervently he rained caresses upon her eyes,
her mouth, her hair, Bess did not know. Instead,
she wondered if the butterfly in her hair
would suddenly become animate and fly away,
so persistently did it flutter its gauzy wings. She
heard the rustle of the silken crepe of her gown
under the pressure of his arm. She felt the amber
beads trickle down her shoulders and strike
with soft patter on the rug, as they became released
as if scissors had snapped their cord. Unconsciously
she stooped to pick them up, but the
man held her fast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&#8212;please&#8212;!&#8221; she cried. Summoning all
her strength she wrested herself free, her heart
beating wildly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Forgive me, dear&#8212;I could devour you! You
were never so beautiful, so lovable before! I&#8217;m
sorry to have frightened you,&#8221; said Davis, his
voice scarcely audible in its emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bess,&#8221; he began more calmly, &#8220;I dare not tell
myself how happy you have made me. To think
that you are really mine&#8212;mine! To know that
I may take you away from here, this dreadful
country with its sordid conditions, its Indians.
To feel that you have given me the right to place
you in a realm where you may be the queen that
you are!&#8221;</p>

<p>Taking her gently by the hand he led her to a
seat and then began telling her his plans. He
said that no preparations need be made as to
trousseau, as everything could be procured after
they had reached New York, as she objected to
being married so soon. Rather reluctantly he
consented to her wish to be married here at <em>HW</em>
ranch and by Father Damien of St. Ignatius
Mission. It should be very quiet with no guests
present.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall have a bridesmaid, however,&#8221; said
Bess. &#8220;I have just received word that my dearest
friend will be here tomorrow&#8212;Berenice Morton.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mor&#8212;ton&#8212;did you say&#8212;Morton?&#8221; asked
Mr. Davis, in a strange voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I never told you of her?&#8221; added Bess,
apparently unnoticing any embarrassment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span> &#8220;We
were at the convent school together, and just the
greatest of chums! I have not seen her since
then, and now I can scarcely wait until she arrives.
She wrote me that her visit could be only
three weeks, but I am sure that she can be
prevailed upon to be my bridesmaid, and then
she could return with me&#8212;with us&#8212;as far as
New York. Where is her home, did you ask?
She, with her father and an invalid sister, have
been spending the past few months in the mountains
in New Hampshire. I do not know whether
they will return to their home near Boston or
not. You see&#8212;so many&#8212;many heartaches
were&#8212;&#8221; Bess could not finish her sentence. The
swift rush of tears choked her voice as the flood
of memory swept over her.</p>

<p>Twice did Mr. Davis attempt to speak before
he felt he had assumed control of his voice. It
was not pity, nor sympathy, however, which
stirred his soul. It was fear&#8212;fear lest she
should detect his confusion; fear lest her friend
should prove to be the same girl whom he had
met only once before&#8212;five years before. But
then, if she were the same, he had changed so
greatly that surely she would not remember him.
An invalid sister! Could it be possible that after
all she&#8212;<em>she</em>&#8212;was still living! Surely, she had
died&#8212;he was positive! Perhaps there had been
a third sister&#8212;there must have been; still ...</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you thinking of so seriously?&#8221;
asked Bess, as his prolonged silence made her
turn from the window.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking, my dear, of how&#8212;of what I
have to tell you. I have received word from
Washington to come there at once. Undoubtedly
it is business concerning my&#8212;resignation,
which I recently submitted. I fear it may keep
me from you for several weeks, and that my return
may be impossible before the tenth of October.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! you need not mind. I am sure that
Berenice and I shall be able to enjoy ourselves,&#8221;
said Bess, carelessly. If he felt any chagrin at
her indifference he did not exhibit it when he
bade her good-bye. As the man remounted his
horse and rode away he did not see the interested
pair of eyes watching him through the curtains.</p>

<p>As much as he dreaded being parted from his
love for several endless weeks, still he felt thankful
that he would not be obliged to meet Berenice
Morton until shortly before the wedding, as
there might be a possibility of his being recognized,
and should such be the case he feared the
consequences. As it was, he was taking a long
chance, and unless something unforeseen should
occur he must face the inevitable meeting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;why not, after I am gone,
try to persuade her to come to me? I can easily
find some excuse which will make her coming to
me imperative!&#8221;</p>

<p>As he hastened on he already tried to formulate
some plan whereby his return would be unnecessary,
and consequently an embarrassing
meeting might be eliminated.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a><br />
<span class="medium">BERENICE MORTON&#8217;S ARRIVAL</span></h2>


<p>&#8220;Stand over there, Berenice, and let me look
at you all I want,&#8221; said Bess, as she and her
friend entered the living room.</p>

<p>Mrs. West, after the return from Polson,
where she and Bess had gone together to meet
their visitor, had slipped quietly away that the
two young women might be alone during the first
moments.</p>

<p>Berenice Morton did as requested and walked
to the far end of the room. Bess clasped her
hands across her breast as she feasted her eyes
upon her friend. Tall, even taller than Bess herself,
and graceful as a swaying reed, she moved
with sweet dignity. As she turned about her
large, grey eyes, with their dark lashes, her rosy
cheeks, aflame with a new excitement, her lips
curved in a sweet smile, made a picture, set in a
frame of burnished light hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&#8212;Bess, dear, isn&#8217;t this enough?&#8221; laughingly
questioned Berenice, when she felt Bess had
inspected her sufficiently.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;How your glasses change your looks! They
make you seem so dignified that I really wonder
if you are the same girl that used to help me play
some of those dreadful pranks. Your hair, which
you always declared was just like mine, is ever so
much lighter, and&#8212;dear me!&#8212;so much &#8216;kinkier.&#8217;
Oh! If I only were g-r-a-n-d like you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were only s-w-e-e-t like you!&#8221; replied
Miss Morton, as again they embraced each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Berenice, of course, I have ten million things
to tell you, three of &#8216;<em>whom</em>&#8217; are very important.
But first you must get freshened up and rested.
Then, after luncheon, I&#8217;ll take you to my den&#8212;&#8217;way
off along the lake, where no one dares to go
&#8217;ceptin&#8217; me,&#8221; she said, in a low, sepulchral tone,
which might make one surmise all kinds of terrible
things.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bess! don&#8217;t take me if there is any danger of
mountain lions, or bears, or&#8212;or&#8212;Indians.
Father made me promise to come back with my
hair all on and with my body intact,&#8221; Berenice
tried to say seriously, but her sparkling eyes belied
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about your heart, Miss Lady? Did he
warn you about that also?&#8221; laughed Bess, as she
linked her arm through her friend&#8217;s and led her
upstairs into her room.</p>

<p>&#8220;How perfectly dear, Bess! No wonder you
have been so happy and contented here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do look at those wonderful mountains, that
great expanse of water, those towering trees, that&#8212;oh!
everything!&#8221; ejaculated the stranger, as
she gazed out of the opened window.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span> &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it
magnificent?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, do you wonder at all the ravings my
letters contained, Berenice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I do not, and I do not wonder that you
wrote that you could stay here always.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Always!&#8221; thought Bess, &#8220;always.&#8221; And yet
soon would she leave this sublime beauty, and she
could feast her heart only upon its memory.
Could she make the sacrifice?</p>

<p>Bess left her friend and hastened to the dining-room
to be of assistance there. She cautioned
Mrs. West against saying anything at all
concerning Mr. Davis, until she might announce
her engagement to Miss Morton.</p>

<p>How deeply Mrs. West and Bess regretted
that the &#8220;boys&#8221; would not reach home until tomorrow.</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; said Bess, &#8220;I am glad to get a
chance for a word or two before James comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>A bunch of rose-berries, large and scarlet, intermingled
with the white berries on stems of
buck-bush, graced the center of the table, while
at each plate lay a shining spray of Oregon grape
leaves.</p>

<p>After the simple meal was finished the girls
arose to leave the room. Berenice reached to
pluck some of the rose-berries for her hair, when
she abruptly gathered Mrs. West into her arms.
She put her cheek against the soft, white hair
and kissed her. Then, looking into the woman&#8217;s
dark eyes: &#8220;My dear mother&#8217;s hair was like
this,&#8221; she said, stroking it gently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span> &#8220;Bess tried to
tell me in her letters of her &#8216;little Mother,&#8217; but
she failed. You are dear&#8212;more dear than one
can say, or tell, or even feel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. West&#8217;s only reply to this unexpected
declaration from the dignified stranger was a
firm pressure of the girl&#8217;s hands. She watched
the pair as they descended the steps and wandered
off toward the lake shore, where she knew
Bess sought her favorite retreat.</p>

<p>On and on they walked until at length they
came to an abrupt rise in the ground. Bess led
the way around the rocks to a huge boulder, softened
by mosses and lichens, projecting far out
from its supporting rocks. They bent their heads
as they entered the partial enclosure, and were
soon seated upon large, smooth blocks which had
been sawed from a huge pine log. One had been
utilized for a table, upon which lay several worn
magazines. A thick carpet of pine needles which
Bess had gathered and strewn in her den covered
the floor. The opening was directly toward the
lake, whose waters were now splashing with
whitened foam upon the rocky shore.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8212;isn&#8217;t this a &#8216;really&#8217; den? When I kill
a bear and a mountain lion I shall place the skins
in here; and the antlers from a buck shall be
hung above the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a splendid place to come and dream!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Bess. &#8220;Henry West helped
me to make the chairs, or rather the seats. It
was warm work pulling on the big saw, but so
competent did I prove that he offered to let me
saw the winter&#8217;s supply of wood,&#8221; she laughed
softly.</p>

<p>Wrapping a blanket about herself and choosing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
a comfortable seat, Berenice Morton sat anxiously
waiting for Bess to begin relating the
million important themes, but especially &#8220;the
first three of whom.&#8221;</p>

<p>For several moments Bess gazed intently over
the lake, huddled snugly in the folds of her blanket.
Then, unfastening the beaded belt and withdrawing
it from beneath its cover, pulling it
slowly through her fingers, she said: &#8220;You&#8212;you
will surely like Henry West.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused for a moment, the while deeply
thinking; then continued, deliberately: &#8220;So
generous, thoughtful, kind; so tender with his
mother; so human, so different, so&#8212;&#8221; and again
her thoughts wandered in search of words fit to
express her encomium.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you care so much for him, dear? More
than for anyone else?&#8221; asked the interested listener.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8212;I&#8212;you see, Berenice&#8212;it was because
of this belt, he saved my life,&#8221; came in an evasive
reply.</p>

<p>Bess felt a wave of color surge over her face,
and the blood in her heart began to pound violently
as she briefly related the story of her perilous
adventure and rescue.</p>

<p>&#8220;James and Henry West will reach home some
time tomorrow, Berenice. James has tried to
appear unconcerned ever since he knew you were
coming this fall,&#8221; she laughed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span> &#8220;and I am inclined
to believe that perhaps Miss Berenice Morton
will be just a little de-e-lighted, too, when the
morrow comes.&#8221; Bess gave her friend an impulsive
squeeze that made reply an impossibility.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&#8212;I&#8217;ve heard of Henry West and also
concerning James Fletcher; what, pray, is the
third item of interest?&#8221; asked Miss Morton, when
she had again resumed her comfortable position.</p>

<p>Bess arose, dropping her blanket near the
seat, and walked deliberately outside the opening
of her &#8220;den.&#8221; Lifting both her hands to brush her
hair from her face, then letting them rest, with
fingers intertwined about her head, she turned
and looked in at the awaiting listener.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the fifteenth of October I am to be married
to Mr. Dave Davis, the Indian agent of this
reservation!&#8221;</p>

<p>Berenice opened her eyes and mouth in wide
amazement. Lifting her glasses from her nose
and poising them in her fingers, she gazed with
astonishment at Bess Fletcher.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bess! And you never told me a single word
of him before!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bess then told her in as few words as possible
of her brief courtship and the reason for the
hasty marriage; she also outlined her few plans
for the wedding, requesting that Berenice write
for her father&#8217;s consent to prolong her visit, that
she might assist as bridesmaid. Soon busy
tongues were planning details, and by the time
the sun&#8217;s slanting rays lighted up the tiny cavern
and warned its occupants of the closing day,
every item, each particular, had been planned
for the coming nuptials.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>The following day the girls began to watch
early for the advent of James and Henry. Once,
as they sighted several horsemen, they ran down
the road, only to be disappointed. It was late
in the afternoon, nearly dinner time, when at last
they came, tired and dirty. Berenice wondered
what the large, woolly things were over their
trousers; why their boots had such high heels;
what all the rope and &#8220;fixin&#8217;s&#8221; about their saddles
were used for, as she peered cautiously from
the upstairs window.</p>

<p>When Bess finally saw them returning she
tried in vain to persuade Berenice to go with her
to meet them, and now she decided that the
&#8220;boys&#8221; should not be told until dinner time of
the presence of the guest.</p>

<p>Henry slipped from his saddle when he saw
Bess coming toward them, and lifting his big
hat and holding the impatient horse with the
other, said: &#8220;Let me be first to congratulate
you. James&#8212;&#8221; but he was interrupted by James
hurrying forward and greeting his sister with,
&#8220;Congratulations, Sister; met Davis early this
morning and he told me all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>West had taken the reins of James&#8217; horse and
led him on toward the gate. The girl did not see
his face pale under the dark skin, nor had she
detected any emotion in his voice as he spoke.
She felt just a little hurt at his unconcern, for
she had thought that he might care.</p>

<p>The brother, with his arm placed affectionately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
about his sister, listened to her brief plans
and heartily approved of them all.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am especially glad, Sister, because I have
just made up my mind to return again to my law
practice soon. My health seems to be fully restored,
and while I enjoy this life, still I believe
it to be to my greater interest to return East.
And then, too, sometime&#8212;I hope&#8212;that is&#8212;perhaps
Ber&#8212;&#8221; but he was abruptly interrupted by
his sister uttering a sudden oh-h-h! and hurrying
into the house.</p>

<p>Not long after Mrs. West called &#8220;dinner&#8221;
from the dining-room. James and Henry arose
from their respective easy chairs, laboriously and
stiffly, and slowly sought their places at the table.
Mrs. West also stood behind her chair waiting
for the occupants of the other places. James
thought he heard a suppressed giggle at the door,
but did not face about. Henry had just noticed
that two places were still vacant, and his slight
curiosity was immediately relieved by two very
tall, beautiful, smiling women advancing into
the room.</p>

<p>James was about to request his tardy sister
to hasten, when, by half turning, he came face to
face with Berenice Morton. So completely was
he surprised that he could not speak a word.
She advanced and held up her hand, which he
grasped in both his own as he whispered&#8212;&#8220;Bee!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bess laughingly pulled her aside, and leading
her over to the other side of the table waited an
instant for Mrs. West to introduce the stranger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
to her son. Berenice returned the firm pressure
of the man&#8217;s hand as she smiled frankly into his
deep eyes. The tempting viands were being
shamefully ignored. One girl was too busy with
her merry jests, while another could scarcely answer
all the interrogatives which were being
hurled at her by James.</p>

<p>Mrs. West wondered at her son&#8217;s loss of appetite
and softly asked if he were ill. Sick? Yes!
Heart-sick&#8212;miserably, utterly, hopelessly heart-sick.
Ill with the pain that knows no healing&#8212;with
a pain that knows no balm! With an enforced
smile he assured his mother that he was
only tired, and made an effort to join in the
merry conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;You two &#8216;boys&#8217; must not plan a single thing
for the next few weeks, except to &#8216;pack&#8217; us girls
about. Don&#8217;t you say so, too, &#8216;little Mother&#8217;?&#8221;
laughed Bess, as they arose from the dinner table.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is, of course, if you can endure me so
long, Henry; for you can plainly see by that,&#8221;
pointing to the pair already departing through
the doorway, &#8220;that I shall need dreadfully to
have some one be a little kind to me, also,&#8221; she
added, with sweetly pouting lips.</p>

<p>His impulse was to reply that he wished he
might be kind always, but instead he remarked
jocosely: &#8220;Perhaps&#8212;I may manage&#8212;Bess&#8212;to
&#8216;endure&#8217; you. I shall gladly help to entertain
your friend in any way I may.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Henry,&#8221; said Bess, after she had assisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
in clearing the dining-table, &#8220;Berenice
shall play and I will sing for you and for James.&#8221;</p>

<p>Song after song was sung&#8212;music, soft and
tender, came from the gentle touch of the girl at
the piano. Bright, glowing coals were gleaming
in the grate where before were snapping brands.
Pale moonlight filtered through the curtains and
filled the room with soft, luminous light. Silence
settled upon all, and each, unconscious of the
others, was deeply absorbed in thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;The place for dreaming is in bed. Come,
my children; it is late and growing cold,&#8221; said
Mrs. West.</p>

<p>What glorious, happy days followed! September,
with its soft, warm days, each filled with
delightful rides and excursions, had given place
to opalescent October, that wonderful month
with its brilliant colorings, its ever-changing
skies and glorious sunsets. Indian summer lingered
on, day after day, and the fervent sunshine
made it difficult to realize that soon flaky snow
would be falling, covering each nude limb and
rock with a winter blanket.</p>

<p>Bess Fletcher had managed during the interim
to complete her wedding gown&#8212;simple
white and severely plain. She had been unusually
light-hearted and merry; still, several times
when alone, as she thought how rapidly the day
of her wedding was approaching, a spasm of pain
had seized her, which fairly made her sick. It
was a strange sensation which she could not define;
and hoping that she would soon overcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
it, did not mention it to Mrs. West nor to her
friend.</p>

<p>Every day brought ardent letters, and sometimes
Berenice wondered how Bess could wait so
long before reading them.</p>

<p>But, most of all, Henry West&#8217;s mother marveled
at her son&#8217;s changed manner. He entered
heartily into all the fun, and even neglected
a number of affairs about the ranch to accompany
the other three upon some of their long
rides. His laugh was frequent and his jesting
talk unceasing. Often Bess gazed at him in
amazement and tried to solve his strange, new
mood. She felt like restraining him sometimes
when his merriment seemed almost undignified,
and beg of him to be his former self&#8212;quiet, calm,
or even cold. Once she came upon him quite unawares
in the library. He was seated at the table,
his arms thrown out upon it, with his face
buried in them. He did not hear her enter, and
as she touched his arm he sprang suddenly from
his seat, overturning the chair. For an instant
his face held its expression of misery, then suddenly
he burst into a loud, grating laugh. Bess
was dumb with bewilderment at his peculiar action.</p>

<p>&#8220;Henry&#8212;what is the matter? I hate you
when you are so unlike yourself! You have been
positively horrid for more than a week! Do tell
me if you are ill, or what I may do to make you
behave!&#8221; she stormed at him, her eyes flashing
with anger and bright spots burning upon each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
cheek. Suddenly West checked his laugh and
passed his hand against his brow as if to stop its
pain. He moistened his parched lips and drew
deep, long breaths, while glowing, intense eyes
pierced the girl&#8217;s very soul.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bess&#8212;Bess, I&#8217;m sorry. Must be I&#8217;m not
well,&#8221; he hesitated, as if to catch his breath.</p>

<p>Becoming alarmed, Bess started for the door
in search of Mrs. West.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop, Bess&#8212;do not go&#8212;I need nothing.
There is something&#8212;something&#8212;I have wanted
to tell you&#8212;so long ago&#8212;something&#8212;&#8221; he sank
into a chair unnerved. The girl walked softly to
his side and placed her hand upon his own. He
clutched it with a cruel grasp, then said: &#8220;Please
go over there&#8212;I cannot talk&#8212;if you are so near
me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on, Henry,&#8221; requested the girl, after waiting
what seemed an interminable length of time.
Her heart was wrung with pity, and she could
scarcely endure seeing his wretchedness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8212;I am sorry,&#8221; he began slowly, as if with
an effort to find words, &#8220;that you are to marry&#8212;that
man. Bess&#8212;&#8221; rising abruptly and facing
her, &#8220;I have grave reasons&#8212;believe me, for hating
him as I do. They cannot be told without injury
to&#8212;to&#8212;&#8221; but his sentence was interrupted
by the sudden entrance of James and Berenice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! Here are the two pikers!&#8221; chided
James. &#8220;We have been waiting ages for you!&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Henry is not feeling well. Let&#8217;s stay at
home today.&#8221;</p>

<p>James gave his sister a packet of letters
which she scanned carelessly. At her brother&#8217;s
request to hurry and see when Davis was coming,
she opened his letter. It was very brief. All it
contained was a request that their plans be
changed and that she come to New York for the
wedding, where he would await her. No explanations
were given for his request. James saw that
the news contained in the letter was displeasing,
and taking it, at her request that he read, saw at
a glance what was written.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Bess&#8212;shall you go?&#8221; and he briefly announced
the contents of the letter to the others.</p>

<p>&#8220;James&#8212;please send a wire to Mr. Davis that
my plans will remain unchanged!&#8221; and she swept
haughtily from the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee&#8212;I admire her spunk, don&#8217;t you, Bee?&#8221;
said James to the girl, as she hastened after her
friend.</p>

<p>One day, as Bess and Berenice were wandering
rather aimlessly among the pines quite near
the house, Berenice exclaimed: &#8220;Oh! what a
novelty &#8217;twould be to have the ceremony out-of-doors!
Here&#8212;right here!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her suggestion had reference to a large, flat
rock completely overrun with beautiful, creepy
kinnikinick, and resting at the base of a large
tamarack tree. The small firs made a dark-green
background, and entwined about them hung
clusters of clematis, now white with downy,
smoky balls.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8212;it would be pretty. All right, we shall!
Just think, dear, only one day more, and then&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my! Somehow the time has seemed too
short,&#8221; remarked Bess, and her friend could not
fail to hear the sadness which crept into her
voice.</p>

<p>Dave Davis had written that his business had
detained him much longer than he had thought,
but that he should be able to reach <em>HW</em> ranch
on the fourteenth. However, on the morrow
came a messenger with a letter from Mr. Davis,
stating that he could not possibly reach the
ranch before the day of the wedding, and that
nothing, nothing on earth should prevent his being
there in ample time.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall explain in detail as soon as I see
you, dear,&#8221; the message ran, &#8220;and cannot express
how the enforced delay has hurt me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me, Bess; I had hoped to know him
intimately before &#8216;the day,&#8217;&#8221; said Berenice, truly
regretful.</p>

<p>If Bess felt any displeasure or annoyance
her manner nor her reply did not betray it. Her
greater concern, seemingly, was whether or no
Henry West would be home in time to attend
the ceremony. Two days before he had received
word from a distant part of the range that some
trouble among the stock demanded his immediate
attention. As he hastily bade her good-bye,
he said he hoped to be back on the fifteenth, or
at least in time to say good-bye before she and
Berenice should take their departure.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a><br />
<span class="medium">A WEDDING DAY</span></h2>


<p>At last the morning dawned. Berenice Morton
sprang out of bed and hastened to scan the
sky. Roseate beauty, softened by a line of tinted
clouds, gladdened all the east. The rugged outline
of the mountains lay clear-cut against the
flaming sky. The sun heralded the new-born day
with wondrous grandeur. The entranced spectator
turned with an exclamation of joy, but
discovered that Bess was still in profound sleep.
She took a step forward to awaken her, but refrained,
as she thought how worn out the girl
must be after all the strenuous labor of decorating
the rooms the day before.</p>

<p>So soundly had she herself slept that she did
not know that Bess had not closed her eyes until
dawn. All through the night her mind ran from
one thing to another. Once she was seized by
the same pain, grown so frequent of late, which
filled her with fear,&#8212;but fear for what she could
not analyze.</p>

<p>Berenice quietly drew the shades and, hastily
dressing, left the room. Mrs. West also thought
it wise to let the sleeper rest as long as she
could, that she might be able to meet the strain
of the day. At the first stir she heard, Berenice
ran upstairs with a dainty breakfast. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
late, dreadfully so&#8212;nine o&#8217;clock, Bess noticed,
as she stretched and yawned with no apparent
concern.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Old Sleepy! You better hurry, or
Mr. Davis will have to be entertained by me
when he arrives!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Berenice, please find James and tell him
that he must receive and entertain&#8212;a&#8212;Mr. Davis,
as I shall be too busy getting into my &#8216;gordeous&#8217;
robes, as &#8216;Peter Pan&#8217; would say,&#8221; said Bess,
half jestingly, as she began to make her toilet.
&#8220;Hurry back, dear, as I cannot dress without
you,&#8221; she called from the banister as Berenice
ran down the steps.</p>

<p>Presently Mrs. West came into the girl&#8217;s
room with the announcement that everything
was ready,&#8212;the luncheon table, the salad, the
dessert,&#8212;everything. Father Damien had come
an hour ago and was resting in the library.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, all we are waiting for is the bridegroom
and the hour of noon,&#8221; laughed Mrs.
West, as she took Bess into her motherly arms
and held her tightly for a moment.</p>

<p>Bess snuggled close and said, with half a
sigh, &#8220;Oh&#8212;h&#8212;little Mother; I half wish he
would not come! I am afraid, I dread assuming
this awful responsibility!&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why&#8212;child&#8212;how strangely you talk!
Surely, you are not in earnest!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have had the strangest feeling in regard to&#8212;to
my going away ever since I promised to go.
I cannot bear to leave you&#8212;my home, this happiness,
these hills&#8212;all&#8212;&#8221; The girl buried her
face against the woman&#8217;s neck and burst into
tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bess, dear, no more tears today. Here comes
Berenice; don&#8217;t let her see!&#8221;</p>

<p>But the eyes were not dried quickly enough,
for as Berenice came hurrying into the room she
exclaimed: &#8220;So you&#8217;re like all the other brides;
they all have to have a weep, I&#8217;m told,&#8221; and she
gave Bess a vigorous shake as she continued:
&#8220;Cheer up, dearie&#8212;for&#8212;&#8216;behold, the bridegroom
co-om-eth.&#8217;&#8221; She sang the familiar air in closing
her adjuration.</p>

<p>Berenice hastened about, putting on the last
few touches, and then quickly made her own
toilet.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you impressed with my&#8212;&#8216;man&#8217;?&#8221;
asked Bess.</p>

<p>&#8220;James did not give me an opportunity to see
him, but hurried him off to make his own &#8216;gordeous&#8217;
toilet. We shall have to wait now until you
are Mr. and Mrs. Davis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; came from Bess&#8217; lips in a startled
breath, as again she felt a sharp pain at her
heart.</p>

<p>James had been instructed that exactly at
twelve o&#8217;clock he, with Mr. Davis, should proceed
to the tree and wait for Bess and her
bridesmaid there at the rock. Mrs. West had
watched until the last moment for her son&#8217;s return,
but he had not come, although one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
cowboys said he thought he had seen him early
in the morning. She decided it must have been
one of the other men passing through the yards.</p>

<p>Bess heard the stroke of twelve, then she listened
until the two men had passed down the
steps. Mrs. West, dressed in soft white, met the
two young women as they reached the foot of the
stairs.</p>

<p>Berenice wore a pale pink gown and carried
a bunch of autumn leaves and flowers. The simple
dress which Bess wore made her look more
girlish than ever. About her soft, brown hair
was entwined the waxen leaves of the kinnikinick
with its scarlet drops, while long, tendril
branches of the same were fastened from her
shoulder to her waist. Somehow it seemed more
fitting for an autumn bride than June roses, and
Bess had insisted upon wearing the kinnikinick
in preference to anything else. Half in earnest,
she said she wished she might also wear her
&#8220;precious&#8221; beaded belt! As she stopped a moment
before going out-of-doors, Mrs. West kissed
her tenderly and gave her hand a pressure of
love and strength, then led the way to where the
others, together with Father Damien, stood
waiting.</p>

<p>&#8220;The birds are the orchestra! See that beautiful
leaf! Hear that saucy squirrel!&#8221; said Bess,
disconnectedly, as she walked slowly forward,
clinging to her friend&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>Berenice&#8217;s attention was fixed in wonderment
upon several Indians with squaws standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
about among the trees. They had heard of the
agent&#8217;s prospective marriage and decided to attend,
in hopes of receiving some of the &#8220;muck-a-muck&#8221;
and participating in the &#8220;big eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Bess lifted her eyes to Dave Davis&#8217; face
when she took his extended hand and was assisted
upon the broad surface of the rock, she wondered
at the deep love it revealed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has been so very long, dear,&#8221; he whispered,
as his lips brushed her hair.</p>

<p>The priest had opened his prayer book, and,
waiting an instant for the pair to face about, began:
&#8220;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">In nomine patris, et filii, et</i>&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>A smothered cry came from Bess&#8217; lips the
next moment, as she looked at the face of Berenice
Morton. The visitor was still clinging to the
hand James had given her to lead her to her
position near Bess. Great veins throbbed at her
temples, her mouth was opened wide, while horror-stricken
eyes stared directly at Dave Davis.
Mrs. West sprang quickly to the girl&#8217;s side and
assisted James in supporting her quavering
form.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on!&#8221; commanded Davis to the disturbed
priest, with asperity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; came the countermand from a resolute
voice by his side.</p>

<p>With supreme effort Berenice Morton
straightened to her full height, flung her arm,
with wide extended fingers, directly at the scarlet,
angry face of Dave Davis. For a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
brief instant there was an awful silence. All
seemed suddenly turned into insensible stone!</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8212;Dayton Davies! My own sister&#8217;s betrayer!&#8221;
came in a shriek.</p>

<p>Suddenly an ashen grey spread over the accused
man&#8217;s countenance, while Bess Fletcher,
as the dreadful denouement forced itself into
her soul, reeled back against the tree.</p>

<p>As she clutched at her heart the scarlet berries
of the kinnikinick squeezed through her
fingers, like huge drops of bright blood. Her
face was as white as her gown; her lips were
rigid and pale. She saw, with impassive concern,
Berenice&#8217;s fainting form supported by
James and Mrs. West, placed upon the carpet
of pine needles. It had been scarcely a moment
since the terrible words had stunned them all,
and yet it seemed hours.</p>

<p>&#8220;A mistake, Father Damien, continue!&#8221; said
Davis, with a voice hoarse with anger.</p>

<p>Bess raised her hand with a forbidding gesture,
and the priest, seeing the look of determination
upon the girl&#8217;s face, needed no words to
tell him that his services were not needed.</p>

<p>He softly closed his book and moved silently
away.</p>

<p>Dave Davis stepped doggedly from the rock
and turned with parted lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go&#8212;go now!&#8221; cried Bess.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span> &#8220;Atone, if you
can, for that other woman&#8217;s living death! Restore,
if you can, her loved ones&#8217; broken hearts!
Recall from that grave out yonder the victim of
your perfidy! Smile, too&#8212;if you will, at how
nearly&#8212;&#8221; but her throat closed convulsively.</p>

<p>As soon as he had placed Berenice Morton
on the ground, with Mrs. West administering to
her, James rose to come to his sister&#8217;s aid. He
was held spell-bound by her tragic attitude, until
the storm of censure which she hurled at the
passive man had spent its fury. Springing to
the rock he placed a protecting arm about his
sister. In a flash he had divined the reason of
Henry West&#8217;s bitter enmity, and wondered how
he had refrained from shooting the betrayer of
girls.</p>

<p>Dave Davis tried in vain again to speak, but
at the first words he uttered he was silenced by
James saying hotly:</p>

<p>&#8220;You better go quickly&#8212;before I&#8212;before
Henry West returns&#8212;or take the consequences!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell that Indian for me, please,&#8221; Davis
sneered, as he turned to leave, &#8220;that this is his
doing; that the score shall not remain unsettled&#8212;long!&#8221;</p>

<p>Without even glancing again at Bess, he
strode forward and motioned to one of the perplexed
Indians, who, after a few brief instructions,
hastened toward the stables.</p>

<p>Bess aided Mrs. West and James in resuscitating
the unconscious girl, and by the time she
could walk and was removed to the house, all
sign of Dave Davis had vanished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>Leaving James with her friend, Bess hurried
up to her room, where no one might witness her
uncontrollable passion. Not a tear came to
moisten her burning eyes, not a sob to stifle the
pounding blood at her temples. For several moments
she paced rapidly back and forth, her
hands shut tight, her nostrils wide with heavy
breathing; then, falling upon her knees beside
the bed, she buried her face in her arms.</p>

<p>Mrs. West cautiously opened the door and
was about to enter to comfort the girl, when she
paused as the words of a prayer faintly reached
her: &#8220;Oh! My God, I thank Thee for preserving
me this day from danger worse than death!
Grant peace to those tender souls who guarded
me from a fate like their own. Keep me always
near Thee; help me to solace those who suffer.&#8221;
She did not enter the room, for she knew the
Great Comforter was there before her.</p>

<p>It was fully an hour when those in the living-room
heard Bess descending the stairs. James
hurried anxiously forward as she entered the
room dressed for riding.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8212;James, please do not look so. See!
I&#8212;even I&#8212;am smiling! I do not need sympathy&#8212;I
want congratulations. Think how much
worse it might have been! Will you get Mauchacho
for me, please? Do you mind, Bee, if I
go for a ride? Please, little Mother, do not grow
anxious, for I shall not return until I am feeling&#8212;feeling
rested. No, I am not hungry&#8212;I could
not eat,&#8221; she added, in response to Mrs. Wes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>t&#8217;s
request that she first partake of luncheon. Pressing
her lips to the still pallid brow on the pillow,
and holding Mrs. West in her arms as she kissed
her, she hastened out of the house. Presently
James brought her horse and watched her silently
as she rode out of sight toward the north, and
as he turned with a sigh to re-enter the house he
thought: &#8220;I wish I had as much of the Fletcher
grit as she has.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</a><br />
<span class="medium">&#8220;I&#8212;AM&#8212;BUT&#8212;AN&#8212;INDIAN&#8221;</span></h2>


<p>Mauchacho was permitted to choose his own
trail and pace. His rider did not notice when he
stopped to nibble at some tempting grass, or
stretched his neck for a few remaining green
leaves.</p>

<p>A loud neigh startled the girl from her lethargy,
and she discovered a saddled horse standing
near the entrance to her &#8220;den.&#8221; At first she
felt a slight alarm, then saw that it was one of
the ranch horses. Dismounting, and leaving her
horse with trailing reins, she hurried to learn
the cause of the empty saddle. A cry escaped
her, as directly at the opening of the tiny cavern
she came face to face with Henry West.</p>

<p>At first she scarcely believed it was he, so
changed did he seem. His straight, black hair
was in matted disorder; great seams lined his
brow and chin; the erstwhile white silken shirt
lay torn back from his throat, soiled and begrimed;
his sombrero, twisted into a shapeless
mass, was clutched in his hands, while the great,
black, shaggy &#8220;chapps&#8221; made him seem like some
formidable creature.</p>

<p>He stared at Bess benumbed and uncomprehending.
Why was she here? Why had she not
gone with him whom she had wedded? Was it a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
ghost come to bring still greater agony? Slowly
stretching forth his hand, fearful lest the apparition
should vanish, he felt it grasped eagerly by
one pulsating with warm, pulsing life. She lifted
her eyes to his with an assuring gaze as she
spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is really I&#8212;Bess Fletcher! I have been
saved from ignominy by Grace Morton&#8217;s living
death&#8212;by the broken heart of Helen West.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You knew!&#8221; gasped Henry West, stepping
back abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How could I have known? Fate, at an almost
fatal moment, disclosed the perfidy which
you had so cowardly concealed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a coward&#8212;a damned coward, who
could not tell of his only sister&#8217;s dishonor to save
you&#8212;even you, from a life of misery! Since
early dawn have I fought here for the courage
to go to you, to tell you, but I dared not; had I
seen that&#8212;that dog again, he would have been
killed,&#8221; came in a frenzied outburst, as Henry
clasped his hand over his holster. &#8220;This same
bullet has been waiting&#8212;for nearly two years,&#8221;
he said, as he withdrew the gun and held it in
his palm.</p>

<p>Bess reached out her hand. Taking the
treacherous weapon and emptying the chambers,
she gave it back to West. &#8220;There, Henry, you
will not need it now; he has gone.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Gone! Yes, I was told yesterday that his
resignation was not voluntary; another man is
already at the agency to fill the position.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going alone?&#8221; asked Henry
West, as the girl remounted and turned Mauchacho&#8217;s
head toward the rugged north shore of
the lake.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where my horse may take me. Your mother
is looking for you at home,&#8221; answered Miss
Fletcher, in a hard voice, as she bent her head
beneath the branches of a small pine and rode
away.</p>

<p>West stood watching her as she now and
again came into view from behind a clump of
bushes or around some jagged rocks, trying to
clear the mist from his brain and eyes, and assuring
himself that she was not an hallucination.
At length he took the reins from the ground and
led his horse back to the ranch. No one saw him
enter the house nor go to his room; and when
he joined the others late in the afternoon no one
dreamed that the tall, dark man, so immaculately
dressed, so calm and quiet, had a moment
of anguish.</p>

<p>James was seated near the couch when Henry
West entered the room. He arose quickly, words
of explanation ready upon his lips, but he was
silenced by a gently upraised hand. Mrs. West
had also hastened to her son&#8217;s side with a glad
smile of welcome upon her face.</p>

<p>Placing his arm tenderly about her, West
said: &#8220;James&#8212;I know. I saw Bess with her
horse riding&#8212;&#8221; and he swept his hand toward
the northward as he bent and kissed the soft,
white head against his shoulder. The mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
felt the tremor in his voice and the quiver in his
heart, and she knew then the secret which his
soul could no longer conceal. This was a tragedy!
Her son, with the blood of red-skinned
warriors in his veins, loved&#8212;loved hopelessly!
She dared not lift her face from the shelter of
his breast. Seeing that his mother was concerned,
he led her gently into her room. Here
she told him the details of the affair, and when
she had finished he knew that she was still ignorant
of the true cause of her daughter&#8217;s death.</p>

<p>A great sigh of relief escaped him. He could
not bear that the trusting mother should now,
after the sharp edge of her grief had been dulled,
have her heart break anew.</p>

<p>&#8220;James was saying just before you came,
Henry, that he should take Bess back to New
York with him. He thinks possibly they will be
ready to go when Miss Morton leaves. Oh! it
seems as if I cannot&#8212;have her go, Henry! She
has grown into my life so fully that if she goes
away it will be like pulling out my heart!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think, mother&#8212;I&#8212;I feel that it is the
only thing for her to do. I cannot persuade
James to remain, even as half owner of the <em>HW</em>
ranch and stock. Perhaps we may go away, too,
mother,&#8212;away from here; away from these
hills, these scenes; away from the West and our
people. Mother&#8212;mother!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;the sun
will no longer bring the daylight and warmth
when she is gone!&#8221;</p>

<p>For several moments neither said a word, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
overwhelmed was each with hopelessness. Then
a gentle touch upon the arm caused Henry West
to lift his face and reply to the question which
his mother scarcely breathed loud enough for
him to hear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I told her of my love?&#8221; He repeated
her question. &#8220;I could not. Now I am only sad
with longing; I am not crushed with cruel certainty.
I am&#8212;but&#8212;an Indian&#8212;insensible to
love, incapable of feeling; unfit for any place;
disqualified, alone! An Indian!&#8221;</p>

<p>Never before had she heard such bitter words
from her son. Tears filled her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me, my mother!&#8221; came in a voice
full of tenderness and love.</p>

<p>The sun had set, leaving a crimson glow on
the hills, which swiftly faded into the early
gloom. James, hearing a horse, hurried to assist
his sister, but met instead a man who had
brought a message for Berenice Morton. She
tore the envelope open hastily and read its contents
at a glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;My sister is&#8212;dead,&#8221; she said in a whisper,
with a face even more pale than it had been during
the long afternoon. &#8220;I must go at once; my
father needs me. If he had only called me sooner.
No&#8212;no, I am glad he did not&#8212;for Bess&#8217;
sake,&#8221; she added hurriedly.</p>

<p>Just then Bess came, filling the room with
the perfume of fresh air. Her face was still pale
and drawn, although she tried to assume an air
of serenity. She was immediately apprised of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
the message, and began at once to plan for her
friend&#8217;s hasty departure.</p>

<p>Berenice was sent to bed to rest and sleep,
while the others packed her trunk and made all
the preparations to drive to Selish at midnight.
Bess tried to persuade her brother to accompany
Miss Morton, as she ought not to go on such a
long journey alone. &#8220;I will finish your packing
and send your trunks later on,&#8221; she argued when
he said he could not leave so suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We planned this afternoon while you were
gone to go all at the same time,&#8221; said James.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not wish to go now, James. I feel&#8212;I
wish to stay here where it is quiet, to rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>At last, when Bess had consented to come
very soon, at least as quickly as she should feel
herself again, James decided to go on to New
York with Berenice Morton.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</a><br />
<span class="medium">A WINTER&#8217;S VIGIL</span></h2>


<p>Everything was ready for the long drive
shortly after midnight. As Bess stepped out-of-doors
and beheld the glorious moonlight making
everything as bright as gold, she wished she were
being tucked snugly into the seat beside her
friend, that she might enjoy the drive over the
hard, smooth road.</p>

<p>The good-byes had all been said, but Bess
climbed up beside Berenice Morton to give her
one more farewell kiss, then ran quickly into the
house. She flung herself upon the couch and
burst into passionate, burning tears, the first
which had come to release the tension upon the
overwrought nerves.</p>

<p>Mrs. West sat quietly beside her, soothing
her, gently touching her brow and hands. At
length the quiet, regular respirations told her
that Bess had fallen asleep. She softly folded
a blanket about the girl; then, replenishing the
fire in the grate, sat down to watch and wait until
she should awaken. Once, when she could not
hear a breath nor see the slight movement of the
blanket, she hastily touched the unconscious
form. The eyes opened for a moment, then, with
a smile upon her lips Bess immediately relapsed
into sleep. All night the woman watched, heedless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
of the chill creeping upon her, disregardful
of her own great weariness. The dawn crept in
at the window and peered into her white, careworn
face, pointing a warning finger; then lifted
it toward the mountain-tops and behold &#8217;twas
morning!</p>

<p>With stiffened limbs Mrs. West arose, and
leaving a tender kiss upon the girl&#8217;s hand, turned
to leave the room. With the flash of a sun-beam
shining into her eyes, Bess sprang to her feet just
as Mrs. West reached the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Little Mother! Is it late? Why! I have
not been in bed!&#8221; she exclaimed with bewilderment,
as she saw that she was still dressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not hurry, dear. I&#8212;I just came in to
make a fire, and to&#8212;to&#8212;see&#8212;if&#8212;you were&#8212;warm,&#8221;
came with effort, as the woman held onto
the door for support. Bess ran quickly to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother&#8212;Mother, what is it? See! you are
cold,&#8212;your hands, your face! You have been
here with me all night? Oh! why&#8212;why?&#8221; cried
Bess, half beside herself. She almost carried
Mrs. West across the hall into her room. Quickly
she disrobed the shaking form and placed it
in bed. She worked with all her strength, now
hurrying with hot water, now rubbing and chafing
the rigid limbs. For hours she labored unceasingly,
but no relief came to the stricken
woman. Mrs. White had been summoned, and
together they worked, doing everything within
their power and knowledge to relieve the sufferer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>A physician could not reach the ranch before
the next day, and Bess feared that he might then
be too late. Oh, if Henry had only sent one of
the men to make the drive to Selish instead of insisting
upon going himself, she thought, as she
went to the door at frequent intervals to see if he
were coming.</p>

<p>When he came and saw how ill his mother
was, dire forebodings filled his mind. She did
not know him as he sat by her side and spoke her
name, but kept calling &#8220;Helen.&#8221; Bess would respond
to the call and at once the woman would
be pacified.</p>

<p>For days Henry West and Bess attended the
sick woman, relieving each other, that a few
hours&#8217; sleep might be snatched. Once when she
called her son&#8217;s name Henry answered eagerly,
&#8220;I&#8217;m near, Mother dear! Don&#8217;t you know me?&#8221;</p>

<p>With great effort she lifted her pale, wan
hand and gently touched his cheek with her fingers.
Tears of joy that she knew him rushed to
his eyes, but in a moment more she was again
calling hopelessly for her son to come.</p>

<p>Pneumonia, the physician had named the illness.
He came often by boat from Kalispell and
remained for several hours each time. Bess
would not permit her place to be supplanted by a
nurse so long as the physician approved of her
work. In fact, he told Henry West, that no one
could do better nor more than Miss Fletcher.
Yet, when he saw that the girl was growing thin
and pale, tired from the hard work of nursing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
and worn because of the mental strain, he tried
to force her to desist lest she should become ill.
With a look of entreaty in her brown eyes and a
determined smile upon her firm lips she said that
no one could attend a Mother like a daughter.</p>

<p>When the first snow came late one November
day, filling all the land with purity, crowning
every rock with softness, clothing each outstretched
limb on pine and fir with a garment of
whitest down, there also came a change in the
sick-room. Mrs. West had lain in a profound
slumber for several hours, and when she awoke
her mind was cleared of the mist. She was too
weak to move and very faintly came the words,
&#8220;Henry&#8212;Bess,&#8221; as her eyes moved to the two
silent watchers on either side of the bed. Oh, the
joyous looks of understanding which these two
exchanged, to know that after all, their care and
watching and waiting had been rewarded!</p>

<p>Weeks followed. Mrs. West was propped up
against her pillow for a short time on Christmas
day, when the Yuletide was marked with decorations
of beautiful Oregon grape and long sprays
of kinnikinick which Bess had dug from beneath
the snow and placed artistically in the sick-room.
Bess sang, at her request, one of her beautiful
songs. Tokens of remembrance came from James
and Berenice Morton, which filled the girl with
sadness and loneliness. Toward evening, as she
went out to refresh herself with a short ride, she
discovered a beautiful, new saddle and bridle
upon her horse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>When at last the long, anxious winter gave
place to promising springtime, Mrs. West slowly
convalesced from her tedious illness. May came
with calling birds, the tender greens, the soft air
at noon-day, bringing strength to her each day.
Bess, too, was growing rosy cheeked and strong
from her long rides in the fresh, pure air. She
seemed to be as happy and vivacious as when she
had come to <em>HW</em> Ranch a year before. The ordeal
of Mrs. West&#8217;s illness had crowded out her
own painful experience and had made her sweeter,
stronger, better than she ever had been before.
When bitter moments of remembrance occurred
to her she fought out her misery alone, and no
other eyes ever saw her pain or knew that the
sting was not wholly gone. Once James had
written her that he had seen Dave Davis&#8212;or
rather Dayton Davies&#8212;in New York; that at
first he had not recognized him so changed and
dissolute was his appearance.</p>

<p>Now that Mrs. West was fully recovered, Bess
had written to her brother that she would soon
rejoin him in New York. She had wished first to
spend a few days in witnessing the round-up of
horses in June. Bess had been anxious to attend
one of the round-ups, and now she decided to
avail herself of the opportunity of witnessing
some of the marvelous exhibitions of which she
had heard so much.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX</a><br />
<span class="medium">THE BRAND <em>HW</em></span></h2>


<p>Henry West had been gone upon the round-up
for a week before Bess Fletcher and Mrs. White
started. The plan was for them to ride to the
west shore of the Big Arm of the lake upon the
appointed day, where Henry West would meet
them and accompany them to the camp. The
two women were ready for the long ride early in
the morning, and as they proceeded along the
road they chatted and laughed like happy, careless
children.</p>

<p>As they neared the vicinity where Bess had
spent the happy, pleasant days in camp the autumn
before, she felt conflicting emotions of
pleasure and pain. Swerving from the road she
led the way along the path to the deserted camp
ground. The winter had not destroyed every token,
for there were still the stakes where rested
the dining-table; the five, large cottonwoods still
bore evidences of convenient shelves and towel
racks, of gun supports and where the hammock
had been fastened. A faded ribbon which lay
partly concealed by fallen leaves was lifted tenderly
by Bess, as it recalled to her the dear little
girl who had worn it. Mrs. White, one of the
group, heard her give a sigh as she placed the ribbon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
in her bosom and hurried Mauchacho out
onto the main road again.</p>

<p>In the distance Bess could discern Henry
West awaiting their coming. When they reached
him he made them dismount and rest, as Mrs.
White, who was not accustomed to such long
rides, was plainly becoming fatigued. They enjoyed
their lunch, and after becoming completely
refreshed proceeded to the camp which Henry
told them was at the extreme end of the Big
Draw.</p>

<p>What a marvelous and strange place the Big
Draw seemed to Bess! A perfectly level stretch
of nine miles which looked like only one; high,
sloping hills lined both sides, which made it seem
like some mighty river-bed run dry. No cattle
were grazing upon the succulent grass, because,
as Bess learned from Henry West, it was too far
for them to go to water. He pointed out to them,
up in a gulch to the left of the draw, a deserted
cabin, near which trickled a tiny spring. Bess
wished a drink, but when he told them the place
was called Rattlesnake Gulch and that the
Frenchman and his squaw had been forced to
leave the place because of the venomous intrusions,
she hastily recovered from her thirst
and hurried on.</p>

<p>At last the glow of the camp-fires was seen;
the numerous tents gave assurance of a good
night&#8217;s rest, while the delicious aroma of coffee
told the weary visitors that supper was ready.</p>

<p>Bess and Mrs. White were greeted and made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
welcome by the several other women in camp.
Seeing that the little woman was almost ready
to drop, Bess asked if she might remove her to
their tent. Here she was made comfortable and
was soon enjoying the tea and toast which one of
the women brought to her.</p>

<p>During the night the new, strange noises, as
well as the brilliant moonlight made sleep impossible
to Bess. She crept quietly out of bed
and wrapping a huge blanket around her,
stepped out before the tent. How wondrous
was the night! In the distant moonlight she
could see the wranglers who were guarding the
restless herd of horses, riding slowly back and
forth. She heard a boyish voice singing softly
as he rode about the cavie. Just now she discovered
quite near the tent, a man rolled in a blanket
and asleep upon the ground, his head resting
upon a saddle. With a startled movement she
turned to re-enter her shelter, when a deep, low
voice said, &#8220;Do not be afraid Bess. I am sleeping
here that you&#8212;that the ladies may feel secure.&#8221;
It was Henry West.</p>

<p>The grey dawn came creeping up through the
long draw and peered into Bess&#8217; tent before she
could close her eyes and lose herself in sleep.
When the first pale ray of morning broke, she
saw the man who had kept vigil during the night,
arise hastily from his impromptu bed and hurry
away. She then fell asleep, dreaming of flight
before the mad rush of wild horses, and again
seemed to feel an iron hold grasping her arm and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
lifting her high out of danger&#8217;s path. With a bewildered
start she awoke to discover that Mrs.
White was clasping her arm and shaking her vigorously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry and get up! What in the world were
you dreaming of? I could scarcely arouse you!
See, breakfast is over and the men have all gone
after the horses. If you expect to see the branding
you will have to hurry,&#8221; said Mrs. White, as
her busy fingers assisted Bess in making her
hasty toilet.</p>

<p>At several different points she could see the
smoke arising from the branding fires and the
men riding unceasingly to cut out the victims of
the red-hot irons.</p>

<p>The women had started out to watch the performance,
when a great cry of pain and the smell
of burning flesh reached Bess. For an instant
she stood frozen with horror, then without a
word to her companions turned and fled back to
her tent. Here she sat in a huddled heap with
her fingers thrust into her ears. Here the other
women discovered her, but no word of coaxing
or joking derision succeeded in drawing her out
again to watch the nauseous spectacle of branding.
At noon-time, when all the others were hungry
and enjoying the delicious roast, Bess felt
sick at the very mention of food. All she wanted
was her horse so that she might ride far away
from all the confusion and heart-rending sounds.</p>

<p>Henry West asked Bess if she would ride part
way with one of the women who was returning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
her home at Dayton Creek. &#8220;By the time you return
the branding will be over for today, and
then tomorrow I will accompany you and Mrs.
White part of the way home. I cannot tell you
how sorry I am that you are feeling so disturbed,&#8221;
said West.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am ashamed of being such a&#8212;a baby, but
the sight of pain or suffering always fills me with
horror. I cannot bear it,&#8221; answered Bess, putting
on her gloves and sombrero preparatory to
accompanying the woman on her long ride.</p>

<p>How glad she was to leave the camp behind
and to ride out into the clear, bright air! The
gentle slopes on either side of the Big Draw were
soft with the delicate green of the tamaracks,
whose vivid verdure was enhanced by the dark
branches of the pines and fir trees. Great rocks
of varied hues jutted forth in places as if they
concealed the den of some formidable mountain
lion.</p>

<p>So impressed was Bess at the sublime grandeur
and beauty of the scene that she was oblivious
of her companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are enjoying the view, also, Miss Fletcher?&#8221;
asked the woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon for being so rude. Somehow,
words always spoil this for me,&#8221; answered
the abstracted girl, as she drew herself together
and made a sweeping gesture toward the bordering
hills and distant mountains. Presently they
neared the gulch with its deserted cabin, and
Bess gave an involuntary shudder at the sight of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
its isolated loneliness. They started their horses
into a swift gallop, and before long came in sight
of the great, high cliff near Dayton Creek.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, Miss Fletcher, I think you have come
far enough. I&#8217;ll take the trail across to the cliff
and will soon be home. I fear you have come too
far. A storm seems to be coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bess scanned the sky and saw dark clouds
rapidly rising from the south-west. A sharp flash
of lightning, unusual for June in the mountains,
gave them both warning to hurry. The one
turned her horse toward the cliff, while the other
reined Mauchacho about to re-enter the Big
Draw. The swift beating of a horse&#8217;s hoofs behind
her made her give a swift glance over her
shoulder. She caught a glimpse of some man,
probably one of the round-up men, riding hurriedly
in the direction of the camp. She felt glad
that she would not have to go on alone, for now
the warning flashes were growing more frequent,
while the wind was gradually increasing. She
noticed the horse&#8217;s speed slacken, heard a commanding
voice speak to the animal, then felt the
breath from its nostrils as it reached her side.
She waited an instant for the man to speak, then
lifted her face abruptly to look at the one so near
her, a smile of salutation parting her lips. For
the flash of an instant the smile lasted, then a
look of incredulity crept into her eyes and
stopped her heart beats. Mauchacho had instantly
responded to the tight, resisting hand upon
the bridle and stood taut as a cow-horse. Deep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
glowing eyes held her fascinated so that she could
scarcely catch her breath! What phantom was
this, so like yet so different from the man who
passed out of her life! A face thin and worn,
with great, burning, piercing eyes; lips thick and
distended above a quivering chin! Could such a
transformation be wrought?</p>

<p>With a sob she recovered her senses as the
man grasped her hand in his own. &#8220;Why are
you here?&#8221; she cried, trying in vain to extricate
her hand from his loathsome grasp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why? Because&#8212;because I had to see you
again,&#8221; replied the man with a voice still deep
and low, yet hard. &#8220;Yes&#8212;look at me&#8212;look well
at the result of your faithlessness! Do I seem
like the Dave Davis whom you knew a year ago?&#8221;
and he clutched her hand with a grasp that made
her cry out in pain.</p>

<p>A strange, loud laugh burst from him as he
nearly pulled her out of her saddle toward him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Release me, you&#8212;you&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say it! Brute! God, yes&#8212;a damned brute,
and all because I loved you!&#8221;</p>

<p>A vivid flash made the already frightened girl
tremble still more. She begged the man to allow
her to proceed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are going over to that cow-camp where
that Indian is. I heard you were there and was
even willing to risk my precious head for just
one glimpse of you. Come! If you must go, I
shall go with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bess knew that it was useless to try to escape,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
so she hurried her horse on as swiftly as she
dared. The wind had now risen to its height and
was blowing a gale. The lightning brought a single
drop of rain from the great, fleeing clouds
which hid the sky and filled the land with oppressive,
early darkness. Great trees swayed against
each other and loud crashes told of a mighty monarch
which could not resist the strength of the
storm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, we must seek shelter from these falling
trees,&#8221; said the man, whose worn face was
pale in the fury of the storm.</p>

<p>Taking Mauchacho by the bit he turned into
Rattlesnake Gulch and hastened toward the old
cabin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop! I am not afraid of the storm. You
shall let me go on&#8212;alone,&#8221; cried the terrified girl,
as she pulled in vain at the horse&#8217;s bridle. Seeing
that her efforts were useless, she sprang from
the saddle, half falling to the ground. By the
time she had recovered her footing, Davis had
also dismounted and had reached her side. As
he did so his horse gave an alarmed bound and
tore away at full speed. With an oath at his loss
the man turned to secure Mauchacho, who was
standing with trailing reins and dejected head
near his mistress. Just then a great tree snapped
and fell crashing to the ground. Taking Bess by
the arm the determined man carried her into the
cabin. How dark and gloomy was the place! A
mountain rat scurried out of sight at the intrusion.
Releasing his hold the man walked sullenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
across the room and stood watching the fury of
the storm from the open doorway.</p>

<p>Bess half crouched against the logs of the
wall, almost frenzied with fear. The howling,
shrieking wind; the crashing trees, the awful
lightning without. Within, a danger greater and
more terrible than any storm could be! Her
hand, which had clutched at her heart, fell slowly
by her side. What was that her fingers touched
that instantly filled her heart with hope and sent
the blood throbbing through the congealed veins!
She closed her hand firmly over the handle of her
Smith and Wesson, the gun which had so long
lain in its hidden pocket all unneeded. But now,
now&#8212;! Could it be that even the shadow of love
for this man had ever possessed her? Had she
not long ago seen and felt the latent repulsion?
Was this transformation made by just retribution
or an avenging God? A feeling almost of
pity swept over her at the horrible change which
she beheld in the man. Tears of sadness at the
sight of the wreck filled her eyes and made her
lips tremble. The man slowly turned and looked
at Bess before she realized that he had stirred, so
deeply was she engrossed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah&#8212;little girl, you are sorry for me; you do
still care for me; I see it&#8212;I feel it, know it,&#8221;
came in a voice at first soft and caressing in its
tenderness, then swelling with a crescendo of
hope till it fairly shouted in its intensity.</p>

<p>He made a swift, decisive step toward her, but
was checked as suddenly by her firm, hard outburst.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
&#8220;Stop&#8212;do not come one step nearer!
You once saw me kill a rattlesnake! I can&#8212;do&#8212;it
again!&#8221; Her teeth shut hard and her wondrous
eyes narrowed to tiny slits, as with a steady, determined
movement she drew the pistol from its
pocket and rested her hand deliberately across
her left arm. So she stood, fearlessly, confidently.
No words were needed for the man to know
how utterly lost was his recrudescent hope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bess Fletcher, I am not unarmed,&#8221; he said
threateningly. &#8220;I&#8212;could&#8212;kill you!&#8221; Not even
her eyelash quivered as her steady gaze held his
own. A faint, scornful smile played for an instant
upon her lips. Nor yet did she move when
she heard from out the storm Mauchacho&#8217;s loud
neigh in response to another horse&#8217;s call. Davis
suddenly turned to the window and his face grew
dark. &#8220;West!&#8221; he cried hoarsely, and wrenched
the door open, attempting to escape under cover
of the small firs. He was too late. In the dim
light of the swiftly abating storm Bess saw a
wide, swaying rope suddenly descend and curl
its quivering folds securely about the fugitive&#8217;s
body, pinioning him within its tightening hold.</p>

<p>West leaped from his horse. Without a word
he secured the lariat about his captive. Bess
came hurrying to him, her pistol still in her
hand.</p>

<p>He caught sight of the weapon.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came too soon,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You would have
used my gift.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&#8212;Henry&#8212;you came just in time,&#8221; sobbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
the girl. &#8220;What are you going to do,&#8221; she demanded
as West told her to get on her horse, at
the same time lifting the helpless man with superhuman
strength and thrusting him into his own
saddle.</p>

<p>The new-comer grasped his horse by the bridle
and started with long, rapid strides down the
gulch, followed by Mauchacho and his helpless
rider. The strain of the past hour had completely
unnerved the girl, who with difficulty held her
seat in the saddle. On walked the determined
man leading the way. On rode the captive in
dogged silence, while Bess followed scarcely
knowing whither nor why.</p>

<p>The storm with all its fury and havoc had
passed. Faint flashes beyond the distant mountains
showed where its wrath was weakening.
Twilight, soft and mystical was settling on the
hills and weirdly filling the expanse of the Big
Draw. Like the gleam of a great evil eye shone
in the distance the fire of the branders, which the
wind had fanned into glowing coals. As they
neared this spot Davis spoke for the first time.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bess waited with bated breath for West&#8217;s
reply. For a full moment he walked on as if he
had not heard. Then he said undecisively, &#8220;The
boys in camp shall decide.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, West, this a damned mean way to
treat any man. I demand that you release me&#8212;you
cowardly Indian!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Indian walked taciturnly on, swiftly,
steadily. As he neared the glowing fire, its ruddy
light painted his face as red as a warrior&#8217;s. Several
of the irons were still sticking in the fire
where the boys had forgotten them as they hastened
from the storm. Mauchacho shied when he
passed the fire with its irons, as if the sting of
their torture was still fresh in his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say West&#8212;this has gone far enough. Besides&#8212;I&#8212;Miss
Fletcher accompanied me into
that cabin&#8212;because she wished to&#8212;freely&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>But before he could utter another single word
of the cowardly lie, West sprang at him and
dragged him from the horse. Grasping the rope
firmly he drew the resisting man directly toward
the fire and flung him mercilessly to the ground.
With one hand he snatched a red-hot iron from
the fire; with the other he tore open the man&#8217;s
shirt and despite the restraining hold of a
woman&#8217;s hand upon his arm he seared the bared
breast with the scorching brand!</p>

<p>&#8220;You dog,&#8221; he roared, &#8220;read that burning
brand! Know that <em>HW</em> means Honor Women!
Honor! Learn if you can what it means! When
again you try to destroy a woman&#8217;s life&#8212;let your
fingers seek this everlasting seal; and for God&#8217;s
sake, if not your own and her&#8217;s, let the purport of
the brand restrain you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Without another word he loosened the man,
placed him again in the saddle and turned the
horse&#8217;s head toward the east where already a
great, round moon lighted the way. West gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
the horse a cut with the quirt and soon horse and
man were out of sight.</p>

<p>In an unconscious heap upon the ground lay
Bess, where she had fallen as the smoke from the
burning flesh filled her nostrils.</p>

<p>West stood gazing down at the white face and
pulseless temples. His own heart had scarcely
resumed its beating and was still pounding with
choking throbs in his throat. All the love of his
heart increased a thousand-fold, all the hopelessness
of his love grew even more hopeless as the
savagery of his recent work forced itself into his
soul. With a cry of despair he knelt and lifted
the limp form within his arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if you were only dead! If I too might
die now with you so near me! You are dead&#8212;dead
to me&#8212;I know! Good-bye!&#8221; he said as he
tenderly imprinted a kiss upon the silent lips.</p>

<p>Slowly her large, brown eyes opened and
gazed understandingly into the face so near
her own. Then a look of horror crept into them,
and with a gasp she regained her senses. Thrusting
out her hands, she repulsed the solicitous
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8212;<em>Indian</em>,&#8221; she cried, with abhorrence.
With difficulty she arose and mounted her horse.
West did not move nor offer her the slightest assistance
as he watched her ride away toward
camp.</p>

<p>Long he stood, silent and immovable, gazing
into the moon upon whose face he seemed to see
in scarlet letters, <em>The Brand</em>.</p>

<span class="medium">&#8220;WHEN YOU CAN FORGET&#8221;</span></h2>


<p>It was nearly a month before Bess Fletcher
fully recovered from the shock she had experienced.
She was now ready to go to New York to
rejoin her brother. Whenever she thought of
leaving the ranch, of going away from Mrs. West,
giving up her horse, of tearing herself away from
the wonderful mountains, the lake and all its beloved
haunts, it seemed as if she could not go.
Her bitterness toward Henry West had grown
less as she analyzed his motive, and from his
mother learned what had really prompted him in
his impulsive act. She had not seen him during
the weeks which followed the tragedy, but now
that she was leaving she felt that she must speak
to him and say good-bye.</p>

<p>She was waiting for him in the living-room.
Seating herself at the piano her fingers unconsciously
sought the strain of <cite>Mon Desir</cite>, and in
a soft, tender voice she sang.</p>

<p>The dark, silent man entered unnoticed and
stood in the center of the room, his hands
clenched, his eyes half closed, listening. When
she finished she brushed away her unbidden tears
and turned to discover her listener. Rising
abruptly she walked to him extending her hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
&#8220;I am sorry&#8212;for&#8212;for&#8212;Can you forgive me for
wounding you so deeply? I did not understand
then; now I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind little&#8212;Bess. I richly deserve it
all. Let&#8217;s not say any more about it.&#8221; Then he
added, &#8220;If you prefer to ride Mauchacho to Selish
I will accompany you. Your trunks can go on
the stage. It will be our last&#8212;ride&#8212;together,
you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8212;yes&#8212;one more ride! But we must
start within an hour. I&#8217;ll go and dress,&#8221; answered
the girl, and she hurried to her room.</p>

<p>It seemed when Bess bade Mrs. West good-bye
that both their hearts were being wrung
asunder. Twice, thrice the girl re-entered the
house to kiss the little mother, to feel a mother&#8217;s
embrace again, to know a mother&#8217;s love once
more. Although the little Mother stood at the
window, blinding tears hid the departing loved
ones long before the turn in the road was reached.</p>

<p>During the long ride both were silent. Bess
was looking with all her eyes at the familiar
scenes along the road, as if she would impress
them indelibly upon her mind and heart. Whenever
West did speak it was to ask some question
regarding James, or perhaps to make some suggestion
concerning her journey.</p>

<p>At last the summit of the hill near Selish was
reached. Bess drew rein and turned in the saddle
to view again the scene which had first met
her gaze more than a year ago. It still lay the
same, all unchanged, all inspiring. She gave a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
sigh as she hurried on to overtake Henry West,
nearly at the foot of the hill. When every detail
of her journey had been attended to he came to
Bess to say good-bye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, let me go to the top of the hill and say
good-bye there to you&#8212;to Mauchacho&#8212;to the
West!&#8221;</p>

<p>Reaching the summit they dismounted. Bess
threw her arms about her horse&#8217;s neck and buried
her face against his cheek. What was it she
heard&#8212;what!</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye&#8212;dear&#8212;good-bye, hope&#8212;life&#8212;love!
Oh! little one; if you could have only loved
me! Some day&#8212;some time, will you come back&#8212;when
you can forget that tragedy&#8212;when you
can forget&#8212;<em>that I am an Indian</em>?&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice swayed her soul as a wind sways a
fire. He loved her and she had not even dreamed
it! How could she have been so blind? She felt
her heart fill to bursting with a delicious joy
which had never possessed it before. Love it was&#8212;<em>love</em>&#8212;she
knew now! Lifting her face gently
to his, her eyes soft with a new tenderness and
lips parted in wonderment at the fullness, the
richness of the new sense, she said, &#8220;When&#8212;I&#8212;can&#8212;forget&#8212;forget!&#8221;
Henry understood. He
bowed and turned.</p>

<p>She stood motionless watching the rider and
the empty saddle descend the hill. She stood
with the soft light of the evening sky making a
halo about her, and saw him ride silently down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
into the shadow of the valley. Was it perhaps to
him &#8220;the valley of the shadow,&#8221; for what was
there left in life for him now except death?</p>

<p>Once he turned and saw the girl still standing
on the crest enfolded in a flood of crimson light.
As he looked, it faded swiftly into purple&#8212;and
then to grey. He lifted his sombrero and rode on,
on to the foot of the hill, and then turned once
more. With an anguished cry she started forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot go&#8212;I cannot leave all this. I cannot
live without you now! Henry&#8212;Henry West!
<em>I&#8212;have forgotten!</em>&#8221;</p>
